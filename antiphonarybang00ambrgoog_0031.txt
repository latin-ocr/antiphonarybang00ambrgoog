importations from Gallican sources.l But the title ‘Salvator mundi’ is of
frequent occurrence in the devotions of the Old-Gallican Church, eg. it occurs
thrice in as many different Collects in the Christmas Day Mass in the Missalc
Gothicum, pp. 34, 35. It is found in an Oratio ad Pacem in the Mass in
Dominica i. in xl. in the Mozarabic Missal (col. 302). lt survives in some
Tropes in W. T. which are of Gallican origin (pp. 130, 131); and in an
anthem in the office ‘De Extrema Unctione’ in the Sarum Manual, whence it
has passed into the ‘Service for the Visitation of the Sick’ in the Anglican
Book of Common Prayer, ‘O Saviour of the world, &0’2

(b) The form of Creed presented in [3 5], though not found verbatim elsewhere,
bears marked traces of affinity to the Creed in the Sacramentarium Gallicanum.
For details see note to [3 5.]

(c) The use of the word ‘Collectio’ for ‘Collecta' as the equivalent of ‘Oratio’ in
[54]‚ [62]‚ and frequently, ‘Collectiq' is the term in almost exclusive use in the
Old-Gallican LiturgieS, but it does not occur in any of the Roman Sacramentaries.
Strange to say, it is frequently found, as well as ‘Collecta’ in the ‘Rituale
Ecclesiae Dunelmensis‚’³ but Gallican influence may have been at work there.

(d) The Eucharistic anthems [109]-[115] show more than strong HispanoGallican
influence and affinities. ln fact they are HispanoGallican anthems See notes.

(c) The frequent use of the specially Gallican epithet ‘carus’ See note to [14]
stanza ix. line 8.

(f) The form ‘Gloria et honor Patri &c’ given in [116] anthem (12), is Mozarabic
and Ambrosian. See note.

(g) The majority of Collects are addressed to the second Person instead of the
first Person in the Blessed Trinity. This addressing of Prayers to Christ is a
marked Mozarabic feature, and is also found to a great extent in the Old-
Gallican Missals Such Collects in the Mozarabic rite witness to the Church's
long struggle with and final victory over the tenacious Arianism of Spain.4
There was little, if any, Arianism in the Celtic Church of lreland. The
numerous Collects addressed to Christ in the Bangor MS. can only be
accounted for by their having been borrowed from some Hispano-Gallican
source.

(lz) The commencement of a considerable number of Collects, ἃς, with the personal
pronouns ‘Tu ' and ‘Te'

This is mainly a Gallican or Mozarabic feature. Let us first take the
case of Collects commencing with ‘Tu’ Of ten Collects known to us thus
commencing, exclusive of three in the Bangor book,

One occurs in the Sacramentarium Leonianum. Col. 368.
