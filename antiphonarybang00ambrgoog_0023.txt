diem vel noctem genuflectentes, non solum pro peccatis deplorandis, sed etiam pro quotidianae
devotionis expletione, studium istud frequentare videntur.’'l

We have not attempted to reproduce the order of MattinS, or of any other part of the
Divine Office, out of the collection of Collects, Hymos Canticles, &c., in the Bangor MS.

ln the almost entire absence of rubrics, and in the great diversity of early Gallican
Offices, after which it must have been more or less modelled‚ such a reconstruction must be
extremely problematical, and in many of its details incapable of proof or disproof.²l

ξ 3. Destributz‘an of Collects-a. We group together in this section and present in
tabular form the Collects which occur in the Bangor MS. Cassian tells us that throughout the
East a Collect was used at the conclusion of each Psalm‚ instead of the ‘Gloria Patri’ which
he found to be the established usage in Gaul on his arrival in that country.³ Each Psalm was
followed by a Collect in the Divine Office at Jerusalem in the fourth century.⁴ The early
Latin Psalter printed by Thomasius⁵ has a Collect at the conclusion of each Psalm. There
is not sufficient evidence to prove the usage of Bangor, but it is evident from the second Table
of Collects, that Collects were appended to certain Canticles, Hymns, and Psalms &c., and
therefore, perhaps¹ to all Psalms, eithersingly or in groups.
