L.H. = Liber Hymnorum‚ or the MS. Book of Hymns in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Paginal
references are to the uncompleted edition of this MS. by Dr. J. H. Todd‚ for the Irish Arcbaeological

later than the ninth or tenth century (p. 1.) Μ1. Whitley Stokes has more recently assigned it to the
eleventh or early twelfth century (W.S. p. ci.) It may be inferred from this variety of opinion that it is
extremely difficult to date the MS. with precision. It may be provisionally assigned to the eleventh
century, and most probably to the later part of it.
