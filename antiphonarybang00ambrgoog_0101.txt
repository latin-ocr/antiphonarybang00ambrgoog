suggestive of the fifth verse of ‘Te Deum laudamus ’ or
of the Trisagion.

Line 4. The line ‘sacris hymnorum cantibus’ is
suggestive of lauds.

Line 1. ‘Gallorum cantibus! This expression bears
tuo meanings. lt sometimes means midnight, and
sometimes early morning about 3 am.

The first of the three Christmas Masses was entitled
‘Missa in Gallicantu’ (Sarum) or ‘Missa ad pullorum
cantum ² ( Vetus Mr'ssale Romanum, Romae, Ed. sec 175⁶
p. 17.) This Mass was almost universally celebrated at
midnight‚ or near midnight, for which ‘gallicantus’is
evidently the equivalent. But in a long passage (Lib.
iv. cap. xii ἓ 19. p. 35) Martene has shown that there was
a ‘primus gallorum cantus' anda ‘secundus gallomm
cantus,’ and that the expression ‘gallicantus' refers
sometimes to one sometimes to the other, that is to say,
either to midnight or to 3 am. We subjoin a passage
in which ‘pullorum cantus' evidently bears the second
meaning: “ln officio nocturno uno tempore psallun-
tur ante pullontm cantum in hyeme nocturni, dicente
propheta ‘media nocte surgebam atl confitendum tibi'
. . . Pullorum cantus declinantis est terminus noctis
qui mox diem parit.’' (Regula Magistri cap. 33. Holst.
Pars ii. p. 230.)

. ‘Gallorum cantus’ evidently means 3a.m. in the

Bangor MS.

Line 3. The MS. reading ‘ob' in the third line makes
neither sense nor grammar, and we have substituted ‘ut '
as probably the true reading. There is nothing in the
context to account for the scribe writing ‘ob.'

The language of this prayer clearly points to day·
break, or about 3 arn, as the hour of mattins or ‘hora

‘Ad secundam! A new set of day and night hour

by a marginal cross. The dotted omamentatinn of

‘secunda’ see note to [m] Note the phrase ‘in hac¹

‘Ad horam tertiam! Instead of one of the scenes

in the Passion (see note to [39)), the descent of
the Holy Ghost on the Apostles on the Feast of

Pentecost, as recorded in Acts ii. 13, rs commemorated

This collect contains a reference to Ps. cxl. 3. This
Psalm is sung daily at Vespers in the Greek and Arme-
nian offices, and was perhaps sung daily at the same
service at an early date in the West. lt is now sung
at Friday⁴ Vespers in the Roman, and at Thursday
Vespers in the Benedictine Breviary. See Apost.
Constitt. lib. ii. cap. 59.

The language of this Collect ‘ad initium noctis,'
implies a time coinciding with the close of day and the
fall of night, a time which might be earlier but could
hardly be later than 9 p.m. See note to [33]

‘Ad pacem celebrandam! The devotions accompany·

ing the bestowal of the Pax here are two anthems
taken from Ps. cv. 6, and from Ps. cxviii. 165, each
anthem be'ing followed by a collect.
· The first anthem ‘Injuste egimus' &c which also
occurs in Judith vii. 19, but which is evidently there,
as here, a quotation from Ps. cv. 6, is part of the
Psalmellus at Mass on Sexagesima Sunday in the
Ambrosian Rite. (Antrplranarium Ambrosianum Vetus,
p. 8, appendix to Miasale Ambrosianum Vetus, edit.
Ceriani, no place or date.) lt also occurs among the
Suffrages at the end of the Litany in the Surum Breviary.
(Cambridge reprint, 1879. Fasc. II. col. 253.)

The second anthem occurs as a Communia in the
Stoma Missal (W. p. 343.) Ι

From the language of the second Collect, which

· embadies a reference to Ps. xc. 5 (‘ut non timeamus a

timore nocturno’) we may infer that Ps. xc. was used
at the service at which the Pax uas given, entitled ‘ad
initium noctis,’ and that the Pax here is part of that
