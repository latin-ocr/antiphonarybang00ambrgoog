percrebuit forma sanctitatis eorum per universum orbem terrarum, et multa coenobia ex
eorum doctrina tam virorum quam puellarum sunt congregata.

Et postea inde sumpsit exordium sub beato Columban0, quod ante beatus Marcus
Evangelista decantavit. Et si nos non creditis, inquirite in Vita beati Columbani et beati
Eustaciil abbatis ; plenius invenietis; et dicta beati Αῑ111οῑἱ8 abbatis Edbovensis.”³

ln an lrish gloss in the Book of Hymns the following curious statement is made about
St. Columba: “Ten canonical Hours he used to celebrate as it is reported, and it is from
John Cassian's history that he took 111ἰε.”4

We need not lay stress upon the ten HourS, but the statement is interesting as preserving
the Irish tradition about the influence of Cassian upon the ecclesiastical arrangements ol the
early Irish Church. Cassian, who had been a monk at Constantinople, cameto Marseilles in
410, where he founded two monasteries‚ and died c. 448.

§ 5. Traces of Ephesine or Hispano-Gallim z'nstuence. “

ln addition to the above features of Oriental origin and influence, we note the following
traces of HispanoGallican influence, using the term Hispano-Gallican instead of the older
term Ephesine, as more convenient wherewith to designate the Old-Gallican and Mozarabic
Service books and including under it points which connect the Bangor boolr with the
ancient services of Gaul and Spain, but which cannot b‘e traced further, directly, to Greek or
other Eastern sources⁵

(1) The expression ‘Salvator mundi' occurs frequently in Bangor CollectS, ie. ten
ῖὶῐῃθὸἰῐι[62] [6311641168] [69],[71] [73], [91], [92], [m]- This phrase is

rarely found in Roman formulae of devotion, and where it does occur it may be
taken as a token of a Gallican importation, eg. it occurs in the Collect ‘Dirigere
et sanctificare,” &c., in the Roman Office of Prime, and also in the longer
form of the same Collect at Prime in the Ambrosian Breviary (Pars Vernalis p.
10).6 The phrase also occurs· twice among the ‘Antiphonae ad processionem in
Laetania majore' in the Liber Antiphonorius S. Gregorii Magni, apart full of

¹ Succeeded St. Columbanus as Abbot of Luxeuil in 610.

² This is Attala, one of the companions of St. columbanus from Irelaud and his successor as Abbot of Bobio
[Edbovensis]. He died in 627.

³ H. and S. vol. i. p. 138. W. p. 178. lt exists in MS. in Cotton MS. Cleop. E. 1. foll. 5r.-7r. where the
following note is appended ‘Ex antiquo manuscripto litteris Lumbardicis scripto cir[c]a annum 720!

⁴ W. Stokes, Gor'dclica, London, 1872, p. 70.

⁶ The term HispanoGallican was invented by the Rev. C. E. Hammond in 1878 (Liturgies Eastern and Wcstcrn,
Oxford‚ 1878, p. xvi.) The term ‘Ephesine’ is much older. Itis found in 1 letter attributed to Pope John VII. and
addressed to Edald, Archbishop 01 Vienne, c. Ab. 707, in which these words occur ‘De officiis missarum, de quibus in
litteris vestris requisistis, sciat charitas vestra quia varie apud varias ecclesias fiant. Aliter enim Alexandrina ecclesia,
aliter Hierosolymitana, aliter Ephesina, aliter Romana facit, &e' (Mansi, Concilio, Tom. ix. col. 760.) This is not the
place to defend that epithet‚ nor to diseuss the rival theories of the Milanese origin of the Old-Gallican Liturgy, held
by Duchesne (Origines du Culte Chrc'tiem Paris, 1889, p. 83) or of its Roman origin, as held by Father H. Lucas
(Dublin Review, July, 1893, p. 564.)

⁸ In the process of transplantation into the Sarum Breviary and through it into the Anglican Liturgy. this phrase
has been dropped, the person to whom the Collect is addressed being changed The change seems to have taken
placeat an early date. The history of the Collect is obscure. Fora similar dropping out of the words ‘Salvator
mundi' in 1 Collect see the history of the Collect ‘Deus tibi gratias agimus’ &c., on p. xxix.
