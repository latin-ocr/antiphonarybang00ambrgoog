Stanza. Line.

writers to begin their Hymns with '

the word ‘Audite’ For other speci·
mens in the present MS. see the
Hymns of St. Comgall [14] and of St.
Camelac [15] The verse now at the
end of the Hymn of St. Brigid, but
which the Irish Preface thereto states
to have been its first verse, com-
mences thus:

Audite Virginis laudes sancta
quoque merita (L.H. pp. 57-8).
Two Hymns in praise of the lrish
Virgin St. Monenna preserved in
Cott. MS. Cleop. A ii. begin with the

same word eg.

‘Audite fratres facta' etc.

‘Audite sancta studia virginum,'etc.
(J. Julian, Dict. os Hymnology, pp.
547, 551·)

An alphabetical Hymn irr praise of
St. Peter has been printed by Mone
from an lrish MS. formerly at
Reichenau, now at Karlsruhe, which
he assigns to the eighth century. It
commences with the line:

‘Audite fratres fama Petri!
(Later'm'sclre H ymnen des Mittelolters,
Freiburg, 1855, Tom. iii. p. 68.)

It may be added that the larnentation
of Scila, Jephthah's daughter, begins

‘Audite montes threnum meum'
(Apocryplro Anocdoto, edit. M. R
James‚ Cambridge, 1893, p. 182.l

1 5 ‘honum ob actum' for asummary of
the good actions and good character-
istics ascribed to St. Patriek through·
out this Hymn see introductory note.

„ 8 There may be a reference here to St.
Paul’s claim to be not a whit behind
the very chiefest Apostles (2 Cor. xi.
5.)

ΙΙ 8 There is probably a reference in this
line to St. Matt. v. 16, where the Old
Latin reads ‘magnificent' instead of
the Vulgate ‘glorificent'

III 4 ‘Petrum' which is the original reading
of B. is also the reading of L.H.,
whereas Petrus is found in L.H.*
The fornrer seems to be the prefer·
able reading as far as grammar and
sense are concerned.

Stanza. Line.
The comparison of St. Patriclr to St.
Peter was a favourite one in the early
Irish Church. A table is prefixed
to the Martyrology os Tallaglrt in
which thirty-two Irish saints are told
off against the same number of saints
of the New Testament, or of Western
Christendom. In this list ‘ Patricius'

is equated with Petrus Apostolus.
(L.H. p. 69.) The same equation is

made in asimilar list preserved in the
Book of Ler'nster. (Facsimile Edition,
Ilublin, 1880, p. [370] 3rd col. line
s.)

111 7 ‘Adversum’ must be taken as a sub
stantive, equivalent to ‘adversitatem'
The reading in both L.H. and ΒΗ]
is ‘adversus'

This stanza is based on St. Matth. xvi.
18.

tv 1-8 ‘mere is a reference in this stanza to St.
Matth. iv. 19. The acquaintance of
Muirchu Maoeu-Machtheni with this
verse has been already referred to in
the introductory note.

⁷ 1-8 This stanza is based on St. Matth. xxv.
14-30. The construction of the last
four lines is difficult. We may bear
in mind that according to the Preface
to this Hymn in L.H.* “there are
three plaoes therein, in which are
‘three words without meaning, inser-
ted for the sake of the rhythn1.”’

VI 8 'fhe first word of this line is torn: it
may be ‘fructu ' or ‘factu'

Vll 5-8 There is a reference here to Gal. i. 12,
16. St. Patrick is called, in the Τ ri·
portale Lrse, “Lestar togai frifuacra
firinni amal Pol nahstal ’' ie. a choice
vessel for proclaiming righteousness,
like Paul the Apostle. (W.S. pp.
256-7.) In the Book of Obifs it is
said, “Sicut Paulus apostolus gentium
apellatur, sic Sanctus Patricius Sco·
torum apostolus nuncupatur.'’ (Dub-
un, ¹844, v· 9⁶l

VIII 5, 6 There is a reference here to Gal. vi. ry,
where St. Paul says: ‘Ego enim
stigmata Domini Jesu in corpore
meo porto,’ ‘cujusque ’ must be bad
Latin for ‘Quique’ the reference
