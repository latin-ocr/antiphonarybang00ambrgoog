Lection on Easter Even in the Roman Missal, and in
the Tract and ‘ Prophiit'ia’ after the fifth Lection on the
same day in the Mozarabic Missal. 111 the Divine Office
11 19 99111 daily at Iauds (ipepox) according to Greek
usage3 at Iauds on Thursday according to Roman
usage both monastic 91111 secular; 91 Easter-tide Iauds
according to Mozarabic usage, and at Sunday Lauds
according to Ambrosian usage. Old-Gallican usage is
unknown, but it was probably identical with Mozarabic
usage. lt is most probable that at Bangor this Canticle
was either used at Easter-tide Mattins, or at Sunday
(and probably Saturday) Mattius, throughout the year
in accordance with Mozarabic or Ambrosian precedent,
so far as the Sunday is concemed.

‚, 13 We have printed this verse as it stands in
the MS. ungrammatical though it be. A
reference to Introd. ἓ 7, shows that it isa
mixture of Old latin and Vulgare phrase-
ology. For further information see Saba·
tier in loro. The reading ¹in Lu* is
‘gubernasti iustitia tua populum tuum
hunc quem liberasti)

‚, 15 for ‘tabuerunt' LH.* reads ‘ fluxerunt!

patris mei et exaltabo eum. Dominus

then immediately follows the Collect,
“ Deus qui exeunti ex aegipto &c.” 162]

Title. For the omission of the word ‘trium' in the

title see Part 1. fol. 8v. note 1. This Canticle is some-

times called the ‘Hymnus (ymnus) trium puerorum?
as later on 111 this MS. [86], 111 the Lecyric Mr'ssaf,

(Oxford, 1883, p. 3), dre. ; but the title ‘Benedictio

trium Puerorum' is believed to be of great antiquity,
and is said in Smith and Cheetham's Dr'ct. os Chnitrbn

Antr'qq. vol. i. p. 187, to have been used by St. Bene-

dict, and by St. Fructuosus of Bragas, who died about
665, but we have been unable to verify this statement.
Itis found in the Utrecht Psalter (101870). No title
is given in S. For its position in S. see List of Abbrevia·
tions.

This Canticle, as found in S. and L.H.* 1199 substan·
tially the same text and order and number of verses as
here. In 1..H.· an Irish Preface is prefixed 10 11,
which has been printed with a translation in the Rezace
Celtique, vol. vi. pp. 264-5.

lt is taken from Dan. iii. 57-88, with one additional
verse.

Use. There being no rubric to regulare its 1199 we
are left to inference or conjecture on that point. In the
Greek Divine Office it is used daily at ὅρθρος; 111 the
Roman a't Lauds on Sundays and festivals ; in the
Mozarabic at Iauds on Sundays and festivals, and
daily in Lent: in the Ambrosian at Lauds on Sundays.

In the Durlram Ritual 11 19 ordered for general use
in time of prosperity. “Et in omni ternpore pros-
peritatis (glossed ‘ebn'isses') semper ymnum trium
puerorum decanta” (Surtees Society, vol. for 1840, p.
184)

This Canticle has also a recognised liturgical use, but
Ι1111119 West only. 111 the Roman rite it appears in the
priests' ‘Gratiarum actio post Missam,' and in an ab
breviated form (Dan. iii. 52-3) with some additional
matter 011 the four Ember Saturdays‚ though it has been
cut down to a single verse in ί8111111910 iv. Temporum
Pentecostes! Originally the full ‘Benedicite' was in
use on all these four Saturdays‚ as may be seen by a
reference to the leofric llfissal (Oxford, 1883, pp. 78,
111, 123‚129·l

In the Old-Gallican Liturgy it was in use after the
Epistle, and in the Mozarabic Liturgy before the Epistle.
ln the latter it was ordered to be used not only on all
'Sundays and Festivals of Martyrs, but also at every Mass.
(IV. Council of Toledo, 1111. 633, 9911011 14.)

On the whole it seems most probable thatin B. it was
intended for use at Mattius on Saturdays and Sundays,
91111 possibly, as the nature of the Canticle suggests, and
as the Mozarabic rite ordered, on F easts of Martyrs.

The Vulgare numbering of the verses has been prefixed
to each verse in the text of this Canticle, verse 89 being
a Christian addition to a Jewish composition.

Verse 58 For ‘angeli' 1,.11.1 199119 ‘aquae,'an obvious

clerical error.
„ 60 S. adds ‘Domini’ before ‘Dominum’ So
also in the following verses, 62, 63, 64, 67,
11, 11, rs, 16, 18, 8ο, 81, 81, 81, 86, 81·
„ br The reading of 1,.11.1 19 that of the amended
text, ‘potentiae'
