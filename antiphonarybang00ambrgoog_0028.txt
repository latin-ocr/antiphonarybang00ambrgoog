The Council of Laodicea ao. 364, marked out the Sabbath and the Lord’s Day as days
to be observed festally even in Lent.l

According to the Rule of St. Anthony food was never to be tasted before the ninth hour,
except on Saturday and sunday.2 Further and corroborative evidence of Eastern practice is
, given in Smith and Cheetham's Dt'atr'onary of constan Antz'quz'tz'es, vol. ii. p. 1824. A plain
statement of Eastern practice on this point jis made by John Cassian³

ln Western Europe, while the Eastern practice of keeping Saturday as a Feast prevailed
at Milan? in Gaul,⁶ and, as we gather from the Bangor ,Antiphonary,⁶ in lreland, in the
Roman Church Saturday was observed as a Fast.

Evidence on this point might be multiplied. lt will be sufficient to quote the explicit
testimony of St. Augustine, who says: ‘⁴ Hence arose the variety [of custom with regard to
Saturday] Some, as especially the people of the East, in order to symbolize His [the
Saviour’s] rest, prefer to relax the fast; others like the Roman Church and some other
Churches of the West‚ on account of the humiliation of the death of our Lord, prefer to fast.'⁷
Further and corroborative evidence of Western practice in this matter is given in Smith and
Cheetham's Dz'ctz'onary os Christian Antiquitas, vol. ii. pp. 1824-6.

Now the ranking of Saturday (Sabbatum) with the Feasts of Martyrs in the Bangor
Antiphonary[11.] is an indication that Saturday at Bangor was kept as a Festival, and not as a
Fast, and that lrish practice on this point in the seventh century coincided with that of the
East and not with that of Rome.

We must guard ourselves against being supposed to suggest that the Church of lreland
was directly founded by the Eastern Church, as the Church of Southern Gaul has been
believed to have been directly founded by the Church of Asia Minor. The connecting link
between lreland and the East was Gaul. Whatever Oriental features may be found in the
early lrish Divine Office must have passed into it through a Gallican channel.

ln spite of errors of detail, and in spite of a corrupt text, we believe that there is a solid
foundation of fact in the following statement made about the origin of the Cursus Scottorum
ie. the lrish Divine Office, not the Liturgy, though what is true of one is probably true of

the other. The author of the statement is an eighth century continental Scotic monk.

ln linking the lrish services through Gaul with St. Mark‚ he makes a statement
uncorroborated in any other quarter, both as regards the genesis of the ‘Irish Cursus,' and as
regards the connection of Eastern monastic rule (which would include regulations as to divine
service) with St. Mark.8
