This seems to be the commeneement of another set ; but the scribe of this part of the MS. had come nearly to the end of the space allotted
to him, and had to complete [94] on a narrow slip of vellum, specially inserted for that purpose, and now numbered as fol- 29- It is evident
that fol- 30 was written upon before sol- 29, otherwise it would not have been necessary to provide a strip to hold the remainder of [94-]

A cross is prefixed to au these sets.

Two more isolated Orationes de martyribus occur later on, viz. : [97] on fol- 317⁹. and [124] on fol. 359⁶.

'The absence of any Collects aster ‘ Te deum laudamus ' in the above series suggests the possibility that originally that Hymn did not ἴοι-ττι

part of nuattins- F uuuuuu h Collects are however provided, as by an after-thought, later on, viz. z [123] [125] [126] [128] under the

title os ‘ Post laudate,’ &c.
