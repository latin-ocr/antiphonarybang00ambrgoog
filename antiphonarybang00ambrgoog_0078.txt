ln the Divine office ol the Fast Syrian Church arr
anthem is intercalated between all the verses ol certain
Psalms on Sundays and Feasts os our Lord. (A. J.
Meclean, Eas! Syrien Daily Offircs, London, 1894, pp.
152, 154.) ln the Greek Divine office on Easter Even
there isan anthem to each verse ol Psalm 118. (Trriadrim,
Venice, 1863, pp. 398-407.)

The lost portions ol this Canticle have been restored
within square brackets lrom the Vulgate. The restora-
tion oi an ‘Audite' within such brackets is ol coursea
conjectural addition to the Vulgate text. For partire
lotiones see Introd. §7- The readings of S. are noted
below.

„ „ [dereliquit. . . suum] the absence 01 these
four words is not due to any desect in the
skin, but to deliberate omission from the
text. They are also omitted in S. where,
however, the words ‘et reliquit deum
factorem suum’ are added alter ‘salutari
suo' There is no room lor such an
addition in the missing portion of B.

„ 16 [ad] iracundiam. These two words are
omitted in the main text, butthe words, ‘et
in iracu[n]dia[m]' have been written on
the margin.

Title. The title to this Hymn in this MS. is the
earliest authority for attributing its composition to St.

Hilary. Cassander printed it lront a very ancient MS.
containing the ‘Regula S. Benedicti,' and a ‘Libellus
Hymnorum.’ He does not enable us to identily the
MS, but the Hymn is there described as ‘incerto
auctore! (Hymni Ecclestosl. in Opp. PariS, 1616, pp. 149,
186.) Muratori is disinclined to believe that the Hymn
is the composition ol St. Hilary on the ground of its
want ol hnish and polish. ‘Majorem fortasse elegantiam
desiderabunt nonnulli ut eunt sancto Hilario adscribant!
(M· v· us>

Daniel prints it among the ‘Hymni dcdaaoror' circa
saec. vi-ix conscripti’ (Dan. Tom. i. p. 191.) Dr.
Julian inclines to the opinion that it isan anonymous
poem ol the sixth century. <Dia onymnology, London,
1892, p. 642, ,S ν.) Beda as quoted below, describing
the mette of this Hymn calls it ‘ille hymnus pulcherri-
ntus,' but he makes no mention ol its being the compo
sition os St. Hilary, and his silence on that point seems
to prove that either he did not know of, or did not
accept, its reputed authorship.

The Hilary to whom this Hymn is ascribed in B.
is no doubt St. Hilary ol Poictiers, who died in 368.
This is explicitly stated in the latin prelace to the
same Hymn in LH. ‘Hilarius Episcopus et prin-
ceps civitatis que dicitur Pictavis lecit hunc Ymnum
Christo,'’ etc. (p. 15) and a similar statement as to
its authorship is iu the Latin Preface to it in L.H.*
lv· 20.)

Although Hilary's ‘Liber Hymnorum' is lost, and
there are no hymns extant which can with absolute
certainty be assigned to him, yet there' is good and early
authority lor his reputation as a Hymn-writer. The
Fourth Council os Toledo, xm. 633, speaks ol' and
defends Hymns as then used in ehurch, ‘quos beatissimi
auctores Hilarius et Ambrosius ediderunt! (Canon 13.
Μ111151, Concil. Anmlrks. Collcc. Torn. x. p. 622.) And St.
Isidore ol Seville, who died in 636, says: ‘Sunt autem
divini Hymni, sunt et humano ingenio compositi.
Hilarius autem Gallus, episcopus PictaviensiS, eloquen-
tia conspicuus carmine lloruit primus. Post quem
Ambrosius episcopus, &c' (Isidorus Hispalensis, dc
Ecclcs. Officiis, lib. i. cap. 6.)

These <quotations in no wise prove that the Bangor
Antiphonary is right in attributing this hymn to St Hilary.
Indeed while on the one hand they give some ground
sor such attribution, on the other hand they suggest the
possibility ol a popular hymn being assigned toa well-
known author, as in the cases ol ‘Te Deum laudamus’
and ‘Quicumque vult.'

There are some internal indications 01 the date of

composition in the Hymn itself, but not ola very precise
character.
