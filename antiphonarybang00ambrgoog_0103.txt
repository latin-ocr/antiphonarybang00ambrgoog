and Lord's Prayer [36] are believed to belong to the

Divine Office, and to be an appendage to the Service ‘ad
initium noctis’

The writer of an article in the Ckrtrclr Quartedy
Reoiero (Jan. 1894, vol. marii. p. 347) maintains the
correctness of the liturgical theory. Itis probro facs'e in
favour of that theory that the second Bangor Pax anthem

‘Pax multa diligentibus, &c' should be found in
the Storoe Μιέςαῖ (W. p. 242), but that fact must be

regarded as a coincidence. The bulk of proof lies on the
other side.

‘Incipit Symbolum) For the position of this Creed
in the Divine Office at Bangor‚ see note to [34].

This Creed is to a large extent unique, many of its
readings not being found elsewhere.

The Ordo Romanor vii. published by Mabillon, and
which is not necessarilya Roman Ordo, contains the first
words of a baptisma] Creed which may have resembled
the Bangor Creed. It began Πιστεῦω εἰς ἕνα κ. τ. λ. and
was afterwards repeated in Latin ‘Credo in unum Deum,
Patrem omnipotentem, visibilium‚' dte. (Murcum
Italicum, Paris, 1689, Tom. ii. p. 81.)

The triple and emphatic repetition of the word ‘Credo’
introducing the statement of belief in each separate
person of the Holy Trinity is a remarkable feature in the
Bangor Creed.

Credo in Deum Patrem.
Credo et in Jesum Christum.
Credo et in Spiritum Sanctum.
Two more Credos are added toward the end
Credo vitam post mortem.
Haec omnia credo in Deum. Amen.

The separate ‘Credo’ for each Person in the Holy
Trinity is found in the Baptismal Creed in the Sacro-
mentan'um Gallicanum. The two further additions of
‘Credo' at the close find no parallel either there or,
so far as we know, elsewhere.

As the creed in the Sacramentorrirm Gallicanum is not
easily accessible, and as it contains further points of
similanty to the Bangor Creed, we print it at length,
marking the points of similarity by the use of italic
letters. (Mabillon utsupra, Tom. i. p. 312.)

Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, creatorem
coeli et terrae.

Credo in Jesum Christum, Filium ejus unigenitum
sempiternum: conceptum de Spiritu Sancto, notum ex
Maria Virgine, possum sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixum,
mortuum, et sepultum. Descendit ad inferna; tertia
die resurrexit a mortuis; ascendit ad coelos, sedit ad
dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis, inde venturus judicare
vivos et mortuos.

Credo in Spiritum Sanctum, sanctam ecclesiam catho
licam, sanctorum communionem, remissionem pecca-
tomm, carnis resurrectionem, vitam aeternam. Amen.
