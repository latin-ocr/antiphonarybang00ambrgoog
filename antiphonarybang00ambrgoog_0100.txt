‘Ad sextam) ‘In cruce positus! We have here
a very early, if not the earliest Service Boolr authority
for assignation of the various Night and Day Hours to
commemorate and correspond to the incidents of our
Lord's Passion and Death.

‘Dominus noster Jesus Christus . . . .
matutinalibus a Judaeis captus,

prima coram Pontio Pilato judice ductus,

tertia illusus, corona spinea coronatus,

sexta cruci ab ipsis Judaeis perfidis conclav.

extitit

According to John Cassian the sixth hour, as an
Hour of Prayer, commemorated (1) our Lord’s ascent of
the cross; (2) the vision ol St. Peter recorded in Acts x.
9 ; “Hora autem sexta immaculata hostia Dominus
noster atque Salvator oblatus est Patn', crucemque pro
totius mundi salute conscendens, humani generis peccata
delevit . . . Eadem quoque Petro hora in excessu
mentis vocatio gentium omnium per submissionem vasis
evangelici delati coelitus, &c'' (De Institutis Coenobi-
orum, Lib. iii. cap. 3.)

[22]

‘Ad nonam) Instead of commemorating the death
of Christ upon the cross at the ninth hour (see note to
[19]) this Collect refers to the visit of the angel to
Cornelius at that hour.

Cassian mentions three events as commemorated by
the selection of the ninth Hour as an Hourof Prayer
(r) Our Lord’s descent into hell; (a) the vision of
Cornelius recorded in Acts x. 3 ; (3) the visit of SS. Peter
and John to the temple recorded in Acts iii. r. “Hora
vero nona inferna penetrans, inextricabiles tartari tene-
bras coruscatione sui splendoris extinxit, dic. . . .
Eadem quoque hora Cornelius centurio in precibus
solita devotione persistens, commemorationem oratio
num et eleemosynarum suarum ante Dominum factam,
angelo sibi colloquente, cognoscit . . .· Petrus
autem et Ioannes ascendebant in templum, ad horam

orationis nonam' (De Imtitutr'r coenobiorum, Lib. iii
cau· a)

‘Ad uesper) MS. ‘Ad vesperas’ M. but ‘Ad
vespertinam' is suggested by the first word of the
Collect‚ and this form of the title is written in full on lol.
18a. [3r.] There is no reference bere to the taking
down of our Lord's body from the cross. See note
to [19.] Vespers are not here followed by Compline,
asthe Hour of our Lord‘s burial, nor does there appear
to be either here or elsewhere in the MS any reference
to that service. But see note to [aa]

[22]

‘Collectio ad initium noctis! This Hour ol Prayer
is thus named in the Rule of St. Columbanus, which
does not mention vespers, but passes on from the men-
tion of the ‘Horae diurnae’ to the mention of this
service ‘ad initium noctis,’ or ‘First nocturn :’ “Per
divinas temi Psalmi horas, pro operum interpositione,
statuti sunta senioribus nostoris . . . Ad initium
vero noctis duodecim Psalmi, ad mediumque noctis
duodecim similiter psalluntur, ad matutinum vero bis
deni bisque bini per tempora brevium, ut dictum est,
noctium &c” (Regula S. columbani, cap. vii. Holst Pars.
it p. 94.) Menard interpreted this phrase, as found in
the ‘ Regula S. Columbani’ to be equivalent to Compline
‘Ad initium noctis’ ‘quod respondet Completorio’
(Menardi, Notae in S. Benedicti elmanensis Concordiam
Regularum. P.1. Tom. ciii. col. 884 See Mart. Tom.
iv. p. 37.) But there is no support for this conjecture,
and no proof that such an office as Compline was known
to the monks of Bangor, or recognized in the monastic
order of St Columbanus. Compline had, however, been
recognized, and Psalms had been assigned to it, in the
Rules of St Isidore of Seville, ob. 636, cap. 7, St.
Aurelian of Arles (545-5 3, cap. 35) and in the Rule of
St Benedict, who died in 543 (capp. 17,18.) There
is no lrnown reference to Compline before his time

Collects ‘ad initium noctis’ occur again in [32] [33]
where see notes.
