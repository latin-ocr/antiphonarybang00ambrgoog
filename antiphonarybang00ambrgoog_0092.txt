noras. 51

kantica spiritalia scripturarum cotidie decantans, siue
manens, aut in itinere pergens, tropeo etiam crucis in
omni hora diei noctisque centies se signans, et ad
omnes cruces quascumque vidisset orationis gratia de
curru discendens declinabat.'' (Notes by Muirchu
Macen-Machtheni in the Book os Amraglt, fol. y. W.S.

In the last line of the last stanza, it is stated that
hereafter St Patrick will reign with the Apostles over
Israel. This simple statement grew into the legend
that at the last day St. Patrick will act as the Judge of
the Irish race. 'l'irechan's Collections in the Book of
Armogh speak of his ‘Conductio omnium Sanctorum
Hiberniae in die Judicii! (Fol. r5o.)

An old Gaelic life of St. Patrick, preserved in the
Lebar Brecc, asserts “that though great is St. Patrick’s
honour still among men, it will be yet greater at the
meeting of Doorn, when he will be, like every chief
Apostle, passing judgment on the men of Ireland to
whom he preached.'' (Fol 2911.)

It was said to be one of the three requests granted to
St. Patrick before his death “ ut Hybemenses omnes
in die judicii a te judicenter'' (Vit. S. Patrr'oi', inter
Bedae Opp. Basil ii. p. 333. See also W.S. pp. 258,
atio.)

There is evidence that this Hymn was known and
amous at a very early date. The second of four
petitions granted through an angel to St. Patrick before
his death was:

“ut quicumque ymnum qui te de compossitus est, in
die exitus de corpore cantauerit, tu iudicabis poeniten·
tiam eius de suis peccatis’' (Notes by Maccu-Mach·
theni in the Book os Armoglr, fol. 8r. W.S. p. 296.)

The third among four ways of honouring St. Patrick’s
memory in all lrish monasteries and churches in the
seventh century was, “Ymnum eius per totum tempus
' cantare.’' (T irechan's Collections in the Bookof Armoglr,
fol. 16r. W.S. p. 333.)

This is generally accepted as referring to the Hymn
of St Secundinus, because the vernacular Hymn, com-
posed by St. Patrick himself, is referred to in the follow-
ing line:

“Canticum eius scotticam semper canere.” (Ibid.)
Muirchu Macen-Machtheni probably had the fourth
stanna of St. Sechnall's Hymn in his mind when he
wrote the words, which describe an angel's prophecy to
St Patrick, “dicens ei adesse tempus ut ueniret et
aeuangelico rete nationes feras et barbaras, ad quas
docendas misserat illum Deus, ut piscaret’' (Book ol
Armagk, fol. ar. W.S. p. 272.)

lengthy Irish prefaces to this Hymn have been pre-
served iu the Lebor Brecc, and in L.H.* They have

both been printed with translations (L.H. pp. 26-34
W.S. pp. 382-5) and we forbear from reproducing
them here.

Metre. Each stanza in thr's Hymn consists of eight
lines, which are trochaic dimeter acatalectic, and
trochaic dimeter catalectic alternately.

It is an alphabetical Hymn consisting of twenty-three
stanzas. Each stanza begins with one of the twenty-
three letters of the Iatin alphabet in succession.

This was a favourite device among Irish as well as
other early Hymn writers. Sometimes each stanza
commenced, as here, sometimes each line commenced
with each letter of the alphabet in succession. Other
examples in the Antiphonary of Bangor will be found in
the Hymn of St. Comgall [14] the Hymn of St.
Camelac [15] and the memorial Poem of the Abbots of
Bangor [rao] In L.H. there are exanrples in the
Hymn of St Brigid, of which, however, only the last
three stanms (x, y, z) are preserved (p. 57) and in the
Hymn of St. Columba (p. 205.) The well known
Hymn of Sedulius, ‘A solis ortus cardine,’ is an alpha·
betical Hymn; so is the less known Hymn ‘Alma fulget
in coelesti: both of which occur in MS. Reg. A. xx. (see
Index.) There can be little doubt that this alphabetical
arrangement of verses or lines is in imitation of thc
Scriptural precedent afforded by Pss. xxiv. xxxi i. xxxvii.

Title. The ‘magister’ in the MS. title is obviously
a clerical error for ‘magistri' 'l'he title in L.H. is
‘Incipit ymmus sancti patricii episcopi scotorum’
‘Magister' is a title given to more than one Irish saint
eg. to St. Finnian of Clonard by Adamnan (Vit. S.
Columba, Lib. iii. cap. 4, where see Bishop Reeves’
note) and to St. Patrick himself in the Kalendar of
Oengus, if we may identify (though Oengus does not)
Sen Patrick with St. Patrick of Armagh.

‘senpatraic cing catha
coemaitearsrotha'

eg. ‘old Patrick‚ champion of battle,
lovable tutor of our suge!

cxxxiii.)

1 1 ‘Audite' According to the last para-
graph in the Preface in the Lebar
Brecc (p. 238b, lines 7, 8) this Hymn
was written ‘similitudine Moysi di·
centis, Audite celi quae loquor
(Deut. xxxii, ι) et Dauid dicentis,
Audite haec omnes gentes (Ps. xlviii,
2.)’ There seems to have been a
special tendency among Irish Hymn-
