characters are found elsewhere in the
same MS.

[1¹]

Title. This is avery rare Hymn, no other MS.
textos it being known to us. It was reprinted, after
Muratori, by Daniel (Tom. iv. p. 88) but without any
suggestion as to its authorship or origin, and without any
note or comment on its text. It does not bear upon the
face of it any evidence of its birthplace or authorship,
beyond this one general negative inference that a Hymn
in honour of Martyrs is not likely to have originated in
Ireland, and therefore must be an importation from
outside Ireland, and most probably from Gaul or Spain.
The metre is too irregular to fall under any classifi·
cation It is a rhythmic rather than a metricat poem.

‘Matutina' See note to [24].

I 4 The word ‘Alleluia’ though only writ-
ten after the first and last verses, was
evidently intended to be repeated at
the end of each verse of this Hymn.
The sense and perhaps the metre
require it. It has been inserted
accordingly.

Vl 2 ‘Qui' MS. But the grammar either

requires ‘Quae’ for ‘Qui' or ‘fir-
masti’ for ‘firmavit’

VI 3 ‘zabulum' For this form of the word
see Part I, Introd. p. xxv. The
same word occurs in W.T. p. 2 3.

Title. This Hymn for use at Mattius on Sunday
is found only in this MS. It does not exhibit sufficiently
distinct characteristics to enable us to decide whether it
is an Irish composition or an importation from the
Continent ; but see note to stanza x. lines 3, 4.

The metre consists merely in breaking up sentences
into clauses of fairly equal length. Its irregularity points
rather to Ireland as the place of composition than to
any workshop of more polished poetry.

The refrain is only written in full after the first and
last verses, but the repetition of its catchword after each
stanza and the mark of abbreviation over it after the
second stanza, imply its presence in full at the close of
every verse.

Stanza. Verre.

ΙΙΙ ι This phrase, like others which follow,
connect this Hymn with the language
of the Nicene Creed.

v1 r Compare Rom. viii. 17.

6 ‘qui nunc cepit! These words do not
seem to be required, and may be
accidentally bonowed from the first·
line of stanza viii. ‘Cepit’ in both
cases is evidently not the perfect of
‘capio' but the present or perfect of
‘coepio’

IX 4 ‘Diximus’hardlymakessense. ‘Divin-
itas’ has been suggested.

‘esse,' which however is not wanted,
or a late Latin equivalent for ‘illum’
See Parti. fol. 13u. note 1.

trinal phrases occur in an undoubtedly
Irish composition.

Introductory note. There are many copies existing
both in MS. andin print of this celebrated Hymn
composed by St. Sechnall (Secundinus) in praise of St.
Patrick. We subjoin a list of theearlier MS. texts,
and of the more important printed editions:
