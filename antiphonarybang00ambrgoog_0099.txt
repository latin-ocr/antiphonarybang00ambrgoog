'58 norea.

The lines of this Hymn run on continuously in the
MS, but the sense seems to suggest a division into
stanzas of four lines each.

Stanza. Line.

I 1 For Irish Hymns beginning with
‘Audite' see note to [13] stanza i.
line r.

, 3 ‘Cumiensis.' See note to title.

11 3 The metre requires ‘gratiasque’

1V 1, 2 Compare the habits of continual prayer
attributed to St. Patriclr in [13] stanza
xxiii, and to St Cumgall in [14] stanza
xxii.

1 The perfect tense used from this point
onward (for we have ventured to alter
‘regnabit’ into ‘regnavit' in the
twenty-third line, treating it as an
instance of the confusion between ‘b'
and ‘u ') prove that this Hymn was
composed after the death of St.
Camelac.

VI 3 ymparadiso MS. The ‘y'is introduced
here as the first letter, in order to
preserve the alphabetical sequence of
the lines.

‚ 4 ‘elizaro' MS. The form ‘Eleazarus'
for ‘Lazarus' occurs in the Codex
Usserionos alter, an early Irish Bibli'
cal MS. (T. K. Abbott, Evangelrorum
Verrio Anteht'eronymiono, Dublin,
1884. Pars posterior, pp. 571, 573.)
We have previously called attention
to the fact that the ‘z’ with which
the last line ought to begin is buried
in this word.

One would have expected a marginal cross to have
been placed before this collect, to denote the com-
mencement of a series of Collects for the Day and N ight
Hours‚ or, if not here, then before [¹7] where a set of
such Collects commences, n0. [16] being perhaps, an
additional Collect thrown in to fill up space, when
the scribe found that the Hymn of St. Camelac did
not occupy the whole of fol. ryo. For the number
and arrangement of such Hours at Baugor see Introd.

‘Secunda’ as the equivalent of ‘Prima' the usual
title of the first of the Day-Hours is a very ancient title,
but has now gone out of use. Itis found in the
Missole Gallicanum (p. 179), also in C. C. C. C. MS.

272, a ninth century ercims Psalter, where the following
collect occurs among Orationes od semndam .-

‘Domine Deus omnipotens, qui nos ad hanc oram
secundam per nocturnas caligines incolomes peruenire
fecisti, conserua nos hodie per omnium orarum spatia et
momenta temporis, et in tua gratia nos semper fac per·
manere!

The office of Prime was notan original part of the
scheme of the Divine Office, but was introduced, first at
Bethlehem at the end of the fourth century, to fill the
gap between Mattius and Terce (Migne Pu.. Tom. l.
col 1135, note.)

There may have been room on the last part of
this leaf for the usual concluding formula ‘Qui reg-
nas!

For ‘secunda' see note to [ro]

This is the first of a complete series of rhyming
collects for the Day and Night Hours. Metrical devo
tions, except in the form of Hymns, are very rare.
Their form here suggests that these collects may have
been intended for choral recitation as a kind of ‘ respon-
soria’ at the end of their respective Hours, but we can
adduce nothing in support, much less in proof of such
asuggestion. Itis made by Dr. Ο. Seebass, Columba
oon Loxeuils Klostmegcl, Dresden, 1883, p. 27.

For something analogous to these metrical prayers at
Bangor, we may refer to an ancient Gallican Mass
written throughout in hexameter lines (Missole Rt'clreno
oense, Missa viii. p. 21) to the metrical Litanies for
Rogation-tide published from tenth century MSS. by
Gerbert (Monumenta Vet. liturg. Alcman. St. Blaise,
1779, pars. ii. pp. 87-91) to a set of ‘Benedictiones
nocturnales ante Isectiones' written in rude hexameters
in the Office Book ostloe Abbot osEoesham (edited by H.
A. Wilson for the Henry Bradshaw Society in 1893, coll.
5 5-7) to the numerous metrical Tropes in W. T. ; to
the metrical ‘Communiones' which occur sparsely in
the Sarum, Yorlr, and Hereford Missals (J. Julian, Dict.
of Hymnology, London, 1892, sub voc. ‘Communiq’
where see also ‘ Offertorium,’ ‘Trope')

It is to be noticed that the dotted omamentation of
capital letters which has prevailed hitherto is discon-
tinued throughout this set of Collects

The grammar would appear to require ‘regnat'
but it has not been thought worth while to alter the
text.
