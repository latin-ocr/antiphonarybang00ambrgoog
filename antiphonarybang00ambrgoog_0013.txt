X INTRODUCTION.

nine-tenths os the contents os the Bangor Antiphonary. The idea os its being a local
supplement is borrowed from the practice os today, and then thrown back more than a
thousand years. The present uniformity ol Roman Missal and Breviary, which causes local
supplements to be made, had no existence in the seventh century.

lt has been suggested that the Bangor MS. is only the end os a Psalter, being the
concluding portion os a much larger MS. volume, os which the greater part has been lost.
Canticles with miscellaneous sormulae os devotion are frequently appended at the end os
Psalters, which from the ninth century onward generally include long litanies to the SaintS,
3ηά later on Collections os HymnS, ‘Vigiliae Mortuorum,' etc.

But there is nothing to prove 3ηά little to support such a suggestion in the case os the
Bangor MS. On the contrary, the completeness os the gatherings os which it is composed;
the large capital A on s. rr. and the motto on its top margin; the sact that lrish Psalters
were almost always divided into three divisions ol fifty Psalms each, and that Canticles 3ηά
Collects, is added at all, were inserted at the beginning or end os these divisions instead os
being written together at the end os the volume ;l the general and, to a certain extent,
systematic character and arrangement os the contents os the Bangor MS. put such a
suggestion out os court.

lt has been suggested that the Bangor MS. is an abbreviated Breviary, a portable
service-book sor the use ol travellers: ‘pro sacerdotibus aut monachis itinerantibus! Some
singularly thin MS. Missals such as the Stowe Missal, and MS. A. 566 in the public
Library at Rouen, have been accounted sor in this way. Speaking os the latter MS. Mons L.
Delisle says: “ ll a cependant du existet, a toutes les epoques du moyen age, de petits liures
ou meme de simples cahiers dans lesquels les pretres pouvaient trouver les prietes des messes
les plus usuelles. On s’en servait dans les voyages et probablement aussi dans les eglises
trop pauvres pour se procurer des recueils plus complets.”²
But the contents ol the Bangor MS. do not at all bear out the travelling theory, and one
cannot think os poverty in connection with the celebrated and much-frequented monastery os
Bangor.
Setting then on one side these possible explanations as inapplicable in the present case,
which theory remains to be offered as to the origin, character and use os the Bangor MS. ?
We believe that it isa companion volume to the Psalterium 3ηά Lectionarium sor use in
the Divine Office,
either (1) on Easter Even 3ηά Easter Day.
or (2) on Saturdays and Sundays in Easter-tide.
or (3) on Saturdays and Sundays throughout the year, and also on Feasts os
Martyrs.

¹ This is the case with the Southampton Psalter (S.) and the two Irish Psalters in the British Museum (Cott.

MS. Vitell. F. xi. ninth or tenth century, and Cott. MS. Galba A. v. eleventh or twelith century.) The Psalterof q

Ricemarch, a twelsth century MS. Trin. Coll. Dublin (A. 4. 20) is divided into the three fisties, but contains neither
Canticle nor Collect. TbePsalters ol St. Columba, a sixth century MS. in the Royal Irish Academy‚ Dublin,
andos St. Columbanus,a ninth century manuscript in the Ambrosianffibrary at Milan, are not arranged in three
fiities, and yield neither Canticle nor Collect, but in its present mutilated and decayed condition the former only
