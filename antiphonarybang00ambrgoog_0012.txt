ξ 1. Nature and objectos the BangorBook.—ln the Introduction ol Part l. the history
and palaeography ol the MS. os the Antiphonary ol Bangor have been narrated and described.
ln the present Introduction the nature and objectos that MS. regarded as a Service Book will
be discussed.

The Antiphonary evidently lalls into three divisions

Division i. extends lroml1r. to s. 17v. ir. to the end os the first hall os the second
gathering. We may regard the Collect written on the lower part ol l. 17v. as merely due to a
desire to utilize vacant space. This division contains Canticles and Hymns.

Division ii. extends srom s. 18r. to l. 29v., tle. lrom the commencement ol the second hall
ol the second gathering to the end ol the first hals ol the third gathering. This division
consists almost exclusively ol Collects‚ having in some cases Anthems prefixed.

Division iii. extends srom s. 3or. tos. 36v. tie. stom the commencement ol the second hall ol
the third gathering to the end ol the MS. This division consists mainly os ‘Antiphonae' or
Anthems, lt also contains a quantity ol miscellaneous matter, the Anthems being mainly
comprised between fi31u. and 33²2· inclusive. lt opens and ‚closes with a Hymn. Nearly
two pages aster the opening Hymn on s. 3or. are filled up by an Exorcism‚ and an additional
Collect ‘De Martyribus.' The twelve Anthems appended to ‘Gloria in Excelsis' have the
sull textos that Hymn preceding thern, though in itsell that ‘Gloria’ might have been thought
to belong more properly to Division i. The contents on and asterl. 34r. areos too miscellaneous
a character to be reduced under any classification.

lt has been suggested there may be found five main divisions ol the Antiphonary.l but we
think that the above triple division is simpler, and palaeogmphically and sectionally more
complete See Diagram sacing page xviii. in Part l.

What then is the proper description, and what is the raison cl'dtre ol this book, which
is partly a Hymnarium, partly a Collectarium‚ partly an Antiphonarium‚ with the occasional
introduction ol Eucharistic and other elements?

lt has been suggested that its fragmentary character may be explained in this manner;
‘⁴ that an Antiphonary os a particular monastery did not contain all the Divine Obice, but only
some portions ol it which were peculiar to that monastery, just as the Irish supplement os the
Breviary contains only those prayers or offices supplementary to the Roman Breviary, and
intended sor the use os the lrish Clergy.”2

But this explanation will not hold. Such Hymnsas ‘Te Deum laudamus' and ‘Gloria

in excelsis' were not peculiar to a particular monastery, and the same remark is true ol
