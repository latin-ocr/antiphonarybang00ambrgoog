ln favour of (ι) there are the Hymn [9] and Collect [127] for the ‘Benedictio Cerei,
and frequent allusions to Baptism and the Resurrection, But as has been pointed out in notes
to [9] and [127] the ‘Benedictio Cerei’ now solemnly performed and exclusively associated with
Easter Even is probably, like other of the services and ceremonies of Holy Week, only the
solitary survival of a ceremonia} act much more frequently performed in earlier times. The
administration of Baptism in the early Irish Church was not confined to Easter, but was also
performed at the Feasts of Pentecost and of the Epiphany. An early Irish Canon directed
‘Octavo die chatechumeni sunt; postea solemnitatibus Domini baptizantur, id est, Pascha, et
Pentecoste, et Epiphania'1

Apart from this, references to Baptism would not be inappropriate, at any season of the
Christian year, in connection with the Canticle ‘Cantemus Domino’

So likewise with regard to the Resurrection, every Sunday in the Christian year is a
reflection of Easter Day, and commemoration of the Resurrection might be made on every
Sunday, or even on every day in the early Irish Church. ln the Sarum Breviary there is a
daily commemoration of it throughout Easter-tide in the shape of a special Versus ante
Laudes.2 ln the Greek Church there is a daily commemoration of it throughout the year in
the Troparion at the end of Lauds.³ This is in addition to the special Troparion in Easter·
tide.4 There are also eleven gospels on the Resurrection read successively at N octums on
Sundays, except on a few Festivals when a special Gospel is appointed.⁵

The four complete or incomplete sets of Collects for the Day and Night Hours, and the
seven sets of Collects for use after Canticles, HymnS, ete,⁶ point at least to the wider period of
the ‘Quinquagesima Paschalis' or Easter-tide

We think that they point to a wider period still, and have come to the conclusion that the
Bangor MS. contains Collects, AnthemS, etc., for use on Saturdays and Sundays, and Feasts
of MartyrS, either in Easter-tide or throughout the whole year, and that the preponderance of
evidence is in favour of the wider alternative

§a Distribulz'on of the Psaller. No Psalm is written down in extenso in the Bangor
MS. The only references to particular Psalms are in the following titles:

(ι) ‘Collectio post tres Psalmos’ [64] ‘Post laudate Dominum de coelis,’
[73], [78], [83], [ ]› [93]
(2) ‘Incipit antiphona in Natale Domini super Domine refugium ad Secundam' [98.]

(3) ‘Super Domine refugium in Dominico die' [¹05]
(4) ‘Alia cotidiana' [108.]

(ι) An inspection of the wording of [64] and of other Collects under the more frequently
used title ‘Post laudate Dominum,' proves that the three Psalms referred to are Pss. 148,
