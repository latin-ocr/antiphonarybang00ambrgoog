d. Collatinus post Canlz'cum. There are eight Collects so entitled [62], [68], [71], [76],
[81]‚ [88], [91], [94]. They are all for use ‘Post Canticum Moysi’ ie. ‘Cantemus Domino
gloriose,’ &c [5]. Six out of the eight are addressed to Christ; one [94] is addressed to God
the Father; of oue [88] the address is uncertain.

The phrase ‘devictis tenebris nostris' in [68] point to 3 a.m. or daybreak as the hour at
which they were in use There is 60 special reference to our Lord's resurrection. The
general purport of these Collects is to ask our Lord as the ‘Salvator mundi’ [62]‚ [68], [71],
[91]‚ to protect‘ His people from the ‘vetus inimicus’ [91], and from all danger, as once He
defended His chosen people in the Red Sea from Pharaoh and his pursuing hosts. They
contain these four references to Baptism:

(1) Deus, qui cotidie populum tuum jugo Aegyptiae servitutis absolvis et per

fluenta spiritalis lavacri in terram repromissionis devicto hoste transducis &c
68.

(2) rios duoque per baptismi gratiam et crucis triumphum &c [76.]

( 3) 603 ergo per gratiam baptismi libera, &c [88.]

(4) lsraelem verum quae unda salvat [94]

These allusions might seem to point to the baptismal associations of Easter Even and
Eastertide, but it is obvious that they would 66 suggested by the triumph song of 1110363, at
whatever period of the year that Canticle was used. ’

e. Collectrbnes post Benedicilc. There are seven Collects provided for use after the
Canticle ‘Benedicite omnia opera’ viz. [6 3] [69], [72], [77], [82], [89], [92]. Their language
affords no indication of the time of day, or of the character of the day or season, or of the
nature of the service in which they are intended to 66 used.

They are probably all addressed to Christ. ln the case of the first three and the last this
is sels-evident. ln [63], [69] and [92] Christ is addressed as ‘Salvator mundi' ln [72] He is
named. ln the remaining three Collects [77], [82], [82] we infer the fact that He is addressed
from the employment of the concluding formula ‘Qui regnas! The mere fact that a Collect
commences with the word ‘Deus' by no means proves that it is addressed to God the Father.
See [71], [72], [7 3] 611 01 which commence with ‘Deus’ yet evidently are addressed to Christ,
and all of which end with ‘ Qui regnas'

f collectiones post tres Psalmos. There are seven Collects which fall under this head
[64], [70], [7 3] [78], [83], [90], [93]. But the title ‘Post tres Psalmos’ is only prefixed to
the first of them, the remaining six being entitled ‘Post laudate Dominum de coeli5‚' which
are the first four words of the first of the three Psalms referred to, viz. Pss. 148, 149, 150.
These are universally associated with Mattius and such is no doubt their association here.
The words ‘quousque tenebrae iniquitatis nostrae convertantur in lumine' in [73] suggest
an early morning hour. For the phrase ‘in hac vigilia sollemnitatis’ in the same Collect
see note t0 [7 3.]

All these Collects seem to be addressed to Christ. ln the case of the first three and the
last there is no doubt. The phrase ‘Salvator mundi' occurs in [64], [73], [93]. 16 the case
of [78] [83], [90] we infer the fact from the concluding formula ‘Qui regnas.‘
