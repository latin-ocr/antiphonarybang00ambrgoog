g. collectiones post Evangclz'nm. There are five Collects under this title, viz. [65], [74],
[79], [84], [85]. This ‘Evangelium' has evidently no connection with the liturgical Gospel
nor does it correspond to the Gospel which is read after the twelfth Lesson in the third
Nocturn in the Benedictine Breviary, which is followed by an Oratio, which immediately
precedes Lauds. See note to [65]. The language of these ‘Collectiones’ implies an early
morning hour ‘pro reddita hujus diei luce’ ‘a vigilia matutina' [65]. The following phrases
are suggestive of Easter-tide‚ if not of Easter Day itself, ‘diem dominicae resurrectionis
nobis sollempniter celebrantibus’ [65] ‘dominicum nostrae resurrectionis initium venerantes'
[74] ‘resurgentem in hoc diluculo Dominum’ [79] ‘diluculo lucis auctore resurgente ', [85]
yet the suggestion is not necessarily true, for in the Greek Church there are eleven Gospels of
the Resurrection‚ one of which is used every Sunday at Lauds (Ὀρθρος) when no special
Sunday Gospel is appointed.

The connection of the Bangor Evangelium and its Collect with Mattins or Lauds is
testified to by the repeated introduction of the word laus, eg. laudes gratiasque referamus [6 5]
debitas laudes et grates unito referamus affectu [74], oblata laudis hostia spiritali [84]

All these Collects are fashioned rather in the form 01 ‘biddings’ to the people than of
prayers addressed to a divine person, but Christ-rather than God the Father is addressed or
referred to in the last three Collects,

h. Collcclioncs post Hymnnm. 'There are four=Collects under this title, viz. [66], [75],
[85], [86]. The Hymn ·.referred ·‚t0 is probably the'metrical Hymn of Mattins; Collects so
placed are rare. Examples may'be seen after the Hymn ‘Veni Creator' as said by the
priest while vesting for mass in the Sarum Missal, and after the Hymn ‘Aeterne rerum
conditor’ in the Mozarabic Breviary (Col. 51.)

The wording of these=·Collects'is not of a sufficiently marked character to enable us to
attach them with certainty to specified ''Hymns; but see note to [66]. They would be
appropriate to such Hymns as the ‘Hymnus S. Hilarii de Christo’ [2] or 'the ‘Hymnus
Apostolorum ' [3] or any other Hymn commemorating the life or work 01 Christ, and especially
His resurrection. Some phrases seem to connect this ‘ Hymnus 'with the ‘Canticum Zachariae‚’
e.g.: ‘illnmznatz'o et salus . . . illumznncor.nostmm' [66] ‘qui infirmitates veiitastz'’[75]
lux orta est [86].

The first three Collects are addressed to Christ3 the fourth is addressed to God the
Father, but speaks throughout of Chr-ist. ’

i. Colleclz'ones de Martyrz'bns. There are-sierollects under this title or ‘Ad Martyres'
viz. [5 5], [61], [67]‚ [87]‚ [97]‚ [[24]. These-commemorative Collects were probably used at
Mattins, though the language of them does not contain allusion to any time of day. The first
five Collects are addressed to Christ, who is besought through the prayers [67] or merits [55]
g [87] of the Martyrs. The sixth is a direct address to the martyrs themselves to remember
their suppliants in the sight 01 the Lord: ‘mementote nostri in conspectu Domini' For
comment on these commemorations of martyrS, see ξ 6.

§4 T races of an Eastern origin and connection. ln the following details the Bangor
book shows traces of Eastern rather than 01 Western usage.
