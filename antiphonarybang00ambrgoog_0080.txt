of ‘mero retentis’; but the latter

reading ‘populo’ may therefore he a
mistake for ‘poculo' We have

‘populo’ Compare

‘instruentur' is probably due to an
unclassical scribe imagining it to corne

The followIng three short anthems follow the last
verse oI this hymn in L.H. They are in the hand·
writing of the original scribe, though the style of letters
is more angular than in the body of the hymn.

(2) Canticis spiritalibus dilectati ymnos christe

consonantes canimus tibi quibus tua domine
maiestas possit placari oblata deo laudis hostia
spiritali per te christe ihesu saluator. To
which L.H.* adds ‘mundi qui.'

(3) Unitas in trinitate te deprecor domine ut me

semper trahas totum tibi uotum nouere.

Of these Anthems:

(ι) is found asan antbem in an eighth or nInth

century fragment of an Irish ‘Officium

(2) occurs as an ι[012110] post Evangelium’ on
fol. 267. of B. [84] p. 26.

(3) has not been hitherto found elsewhere. It is
