IX r-8 This stanza is based on Exod. xvi. 15,
and St. Matth. xv. 33-8.
3‚4 Either the ‘Quam' in line 3 must be
altered to ‘Qui ' or the ‘que' in line
4 must be rejected as superfluous.

6 ‘Formamque’ may be regarded as a
mistake for ‘formaque’ the ablative

case being required.

XIII 1-8 This stanza may be interpreted as enu-
merating four chief means of grace;
Preaching‚ Baptism‚ Prayer, and the
Eucharist

„ 8 The ‘que' here is misplaced being in
sense connected with ‘pro quibus' in
line 7.

,‚ 5, 6 With regard to the frequency of prayer
St. Patrick himself tells us in his
Confession: “postquam in Hiberione
deuenerarn cotidie atque pecora pas·
cebam, et frequens in die orabam, . . .
ut in die una usque ad centum ora-
tiones et in nocte prope similiter. (H.

which he also estimares all things as
chaff’ This makes Dr. Todd sug-
gest that ‘mensa' ought to be taken
in the sense of ‘mensura' and as
‘mensa ' is arr impossible contractiori
for ‘mensura’ he proposes to read
the line thus, ‘cuncta ad cujus men
suram’ ‘Mensura’ occurs in full in
[60] flne a. We prefer to think that
the writer of the gloss was mistaken3
and to interpret ‘mensa' of ‘the
Lord’s Table.’ The word was not
unknown in Irish in that connection.
In the labar Brea we find the words:
‘do meis De ,ἱ don altoir noib,’
which are ‘off the table of (3οά, that
is, the holy altar’ [Fol. rab] As

XV r-8 Throughout this stanza there seems to
be a reminiscence of such passages as
St. John x 143 xv. 13; xxi. 15·
Variations from the MS. text have
been Introduced into the latter part
of this verse.

XVI ὁ ‘vestibus' The ‘vestes’ like the
‘annona’ are of course metaphorical,
and may probably be explained by
reference to such passages as St.
Matth. xxii 11 ; Rev. xvi. ¹5·

XVII 1-4 The imagery here is drawn from the
parable of the marriage of the king's
son in St. Matth. xxii. r·14.

‚‚ 5‚6 An Irish gloss in LH.* interprets
‘vinum’ of ‘the wine of the doctrine
of the Gospel‚' but we are inclined to
see here, as well as in the last two
lines of this stoma, a reference to the
Eucharistic chalice
