‘Collectio post benedictionem puerorum! Τὴε word
‘trium,' which usually‘forms part of this title, has been
omitted by the rubricator as in [6]‚ perhaps intention·
ally for want of spice. The Cantiole is sometimes rnen-
tioned under its opening word ‘·Benedicite.' See [ῃ]

Line 5. ‘Salvator niundi' See Introd. 5 5 (a.)

‘Collectio post tres psalmos’ The· three Psalms
referred to in this title are proved by intemnl evidence
supplied by the language of the Collects which follow
this title, here and elsewhere, to be the three Psalms
universally associated with ancient Mattius, now gene·

rally called lauris, viz: Pss. cxlviii-cl.

‘In fine! The words ‘in fi'ne fat the bottom of the
first column of fol. 23v. though detached‚ seem to
belong to the title of this Collect, if so, they are either
an amplification of the words ‘post tres psalmos' and
mean that the Collect is to be used at the end'of the
‘three Psalms’ (cxlviii-cli& or else they represent the
words ‘In finem' which occur frequently in the Vulgate
[in LXX. ‘'an τὸ πλον] in the title at the commence-
ment of aPsalm. See Psalms iv. v. vi. &a Eut the
words are not prefixed ih the Vulgate to arry Psalrn atter
cxxxix.

Line r. There is a prayer commencingwith the same
first five words as this Collect in 8. It
occurs there after Ps. cl. on f. 991¹. and
is prefixed to the ‘Canticunn Moysi,'¹
‘Audite coeli,¹ &c It runs thus :-

‘Te dominum de coelis laudamus,
Teque omnium regern regum rogamus 3
Tibi uniet trino in quern speramus
Cum excelsis angelis imnumcantamns,
Per dominum nostrum, et rl.’

‘Collectio post Evangelium.’ In the Benedictine rite
a Collect follows the Gospel Lection at the end of
the last Nocturn, which helps to explain the title
‘collectio post Evangelium’ which occurs here, and
several times later on in the Bangor MS. From the
position of this Collect in each series of CollectioneS, it is
evident that at Bangor the Gospel did not occupy the

Benedictine position at the end of Nocturns, but that it
came after Pss 148-150 in Mattius. Three lections,
including a Gospel, are provided on Sundays in Lent,
‘ad Matutinum’ in the Mozarabic Liber Comicus.
(llaredsous, 1893, p 66 etc.)

[66]
Tne language of this Collect leeds to the conclusion
that it was meant to be used after [ra] ‘Hymnus ad
matutinum in Dominica'

S'ee lhtrod. 5 62 The realistic character of the language
here used nrakes it impossible to believe that any rneta·
phnrical kind of martyrdom is referred to. See Introd.
5 6. The Collect,no doubty is an importation from the

Continent It has the ring about it of a Gallican or
Mozarabic Prefacerbut we have not been able hitherto
to trace it toany such source.

The cross prefixed to this colleceos which avery
small fragment remains, the rest of it having been cut

off or worn away, indicates the commencement of a new

series of Collects.

The title ‘Post laudate Dominum de coelis' is equiva-
lent to the title ‘Post tres Psalmos' in [64], the four
words ‘ Laudate Dominum de coelis ’“ being the first four
words of Ps. cxlviii.

Line 1. for ‘canunt' the Ms. reading is ‘canite’
