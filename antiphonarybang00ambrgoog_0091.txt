50 NOTES.

The Hymn does not add to our knowledge of facts in
the history of the life of St. Patrick, but it tells a good
deal about his moral 3ηά spiritual character.

Stanza IThe goodness of his life makes St.
Patrick comparable to the Angels
and Apostles.

II In everything he keeps God's Corn-
mandments.

, III Constant in the love of God, and im·
movable in the saith, he received his
Apostleship directly from God, so
that the [Irish] Church is founded on
him, as the Church [Universal] was
founded on St. Peter.

lV The Lord chose him to be a fisherman
in Gentile waters.

V He trades with the Gospel talents, and
exacts usury from the Irish clans, 3ηά
as a reward lor his labours will one
day possess the joys of the heavenly
kingdom.

„ VI As a faithful minister and messenger of
God, he exhibits the form and action
of an Apostle, practising what he
preaches.

,‚ VII God sent him, as He sent St Paul, to
lead the Gentiles to God.

„ VIII And like St. Paul he bears the marks
of the Lord Jesus on his body (stig-
mata Christi.)

IX He feeds believers with celestial food
3ηά Gospel words.

X He keeps his own flesh chaste, as the
temple of the Holy Ghost, offering it
as a living sacrifice, well pleasing to
God. ..

„ XIII He preaches the Name of the Lord
with boldness to the Gentiles, offering
to them the laver of salvation, pray-
ing daily for their sins, and offering
worthy sacrifices to God.

„ XIV He despises the glory ¹of the world,
counting ithut <as refuse compared to
the Table of the Lord. Unmoved
by the world's thunders he rejoices to
suffer adversity for Christ.

„ XV He is the good and faithful shepherd
of the Gospel sheep, chosen by God
to watch over His people, 3ηά to feed
them with holy doctrine

„ XVII Clad in the wedding garment, as the
king’s messenger, he invites believers

to the marriage feast, drawing the
heavenly wine in heavenly vessels
and giving God's people drink from
a spiritual chalice.

Stanza XXI Christ has chosen him to be His vicar
upon earth, to redeem innumerable
men from the captivity of Satan.

„ XXII He sings Hymns, the Apocalypse, 3ηά
the Psalms, explaining thern for the
edification of God’s people, teaching
the doctrine of the Three Persons
and theone Substance.

„ XXIII He prays to God, without ceasing, day
and night3 and hereafter‚ when he
shall receive the reward of his great
labours, he shall reign with the Apos-
tles, a saint over lsrael.

We have translated or paraphrased so much of this
hymn because the universal acceptance of its genuine·
ness, as 3 fifth century composition, is to a large extent
based ou internal evidence supplied by its style, sub
stance or matter, and grammar. As to matter there
isa total absence of the miraculous and legendary
clement which is found in all biographies of St. Patrick
from the seventh century onwards, nor is there any
reference to St Patrick’s visit to Rome, or to his
Roman mission, or to his deference to Roman authority,
of which we first find a trace in the seventh century,
and of which the Book os Armagh, and, still more, later
authorities are so full. As to style, in addition to 3
ruggedness of mette, there r's a simplicity of style and
diction which it is easier to ohserve than to describe,
and which is redolent of antiquity. As to grammar, it
is to be noticed that it speaks of St Patrick throughout
in the present tense, implying that it was written in that
Saint's life-time, except indeed in the last verse, when
his death is referred to, and then the present is ex-
changed for the future, and we get ‘percepturus' and
‘regnabit'

It should be noted that in this Hymn we find certain
statements about St Patrick in their original and
credible form, which afterwards developed into exag-
gerated and improbable or impossible legends, eg. in
the last staura but one we are told that St. Patrick
chaunted Hymos with the Apocalypse and Psalms to
God,a perfectly possible seat, which before the close
of the seventh century had grown into the almost
impossible statement that St. Patrick repeated all the
Psalms 3ηά the Apocalypse of St. John, together with

Hymns and Canticles, daily, and that he crossed himself
τοο times in every hour of both day 3ηά night.
