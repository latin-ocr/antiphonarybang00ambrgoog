3. Patricius sanctus episcopus
Oret pro nobis omnibus,
Et misereatur protenus
Peccata quae commisimus.

The anthem L.H. 1 Is taken from Ps. cxi. 7.

The anthem L.H. 3 is based upon the following story
in the Tnpartite Lt'le os St. Patrr'ck .·

“Quotiescumque enIm somni quietem capere cupiebat,
videbatur sibi ante oculos continuo prospicere Hiber-
norum insulam, ita quod perciperet sermonem et cla-
morem puerorum in sylua Fochladensi dicentium : ‘Veni
sancte puer PatrIcI, et inter nos ambula ' ” (ivs. p. 25.)

An extravagant version of the same story is told in the
Notes on St. F iacc’s Hymn (lbid. p. 421.)

‘Hymnus Sancti Conrgilli Abbatis nostri! This is an
alphabetical Hymn of twenty-three stanzas, to which an
introductory stanza has been prefixed. Each stanza
consists of eight lines, except the second stanza which
consists of ten lines The metre is iambic dimeter
acatalectic. Every line in almost every stanza either
begins, or ends, or both begins and ends with the
same letter. It was impossible to carry out this principle
in its contpleteness throughout a long Hymn, but it has
been carried out toan extent which leaves it still a very
remarkable tour deferre.

It may be noticed that in the AngloSaxon Tropary os
Ethelred all the lines or many of the lines in the maJority

· of the Proses are made to end with the letter ‘a' but

there does not appear to be any attempt to regulate
the letters with thch the lines commence. (Surtees
Society Publications, vol. lx. pp. 285-318.) See also a
Sequence for ‘Fer iv. post Pentecosten'in the Yark
Mr'ssal (Ibr'd. vol. lix. p. 156.) For other IrIsh speci·
mens of such arrangement see the ‘Versiculi familiae
Benchuir’ [95] and the poem ‘in memoriam abbatum
nostrorum' [129] further on in this Bangor book.

St. Comgall In additi0n to the facts mentioned about
this SaInt in Partul. p. ix. it is worthy of mention that
he is inroked fn the following places:

(α) Among the ‘Sancti Monachi' in a ninth century
‘Libellus precum ’ published in Mart. (Tom. iii. Lib. iu.
cap. xxxin p. 238.) This is a Fleury MS. exhibiting
traces of Celtic influence, and probably therefore com-
ing originally from Britany. A list of the Celtic Saints
invohed in it will be found in a note in the appendix to
this volume. Scep. 96.

Ἰ (b) Among the ‘Sancti Abbates,’ after St Benedict in
the Culdee Litany, connected with Dunkeld in Scotland,
and printed in H. and S. rol. ii. Pt. i. p. 278.
