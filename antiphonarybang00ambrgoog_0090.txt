To which must be added the present edition ol the Anti·

Some further publications of this Hymn in honour of
St. Patrick are mentioned in U. Chevalier’s Repertorium
llymnologicum, Louvain, 1889, lasc. i. pp. 91-2.

Very little is known about St. Sechnall or S. Secun-
dinus, the composer ol this Hymn. The Irish annals
simply record his death. The following is the notice ol
that event in the nnnats of Ulster‚ nu. 447. “Quies
Secundini sancti lxxv⁰ anno etatis sue.” (Edit. W. H.
Hennessey, Dublin, 1887, vol. i. p. 12.) He is enum-
erated in Tirechan's Collections among the Bishops
ordained by St. Patrick in Ireland, but no further details
about him are given (Book ol Armoglr, sol. 9a.; W.S. p.
304.) ln the notes by Muirchu Maccumachtheni he is
not even mentioned.

In the ‘Liber Angueli' (or Book ol the Angel) an
early ninth century forgery to promote the primatial
clainrs ol Armagh and the papal claims ol Rome, inserted
between the Additions to Tirechan's Collections and St.
Patrick’s Conlession in the Book os Aronogh, Secundinus
is mentioned along with Auxilius, Patricius, and Benig-

nus, as ordering that appeals should lie in case ol dis
putes, first to the Archiepiscopal See ol St. Patrick
[Armagh] and secondly to the See ol St. Peter at Rome.
(Ibid. iol. aro.; W.S. p. 356.)

Iu later Irish literature eg. the Prelace to this Hymn
in L.H.* (printed with a translation W.S. pp. 382-5) and
in the Presace to it in the labor Brecc (printed with a
translation in L.H. pp. 26-34) which are too lengthy to

reproduce here, several other traditions are recorded .

about St. Sechnall, eg. we are told that the Hymn was
written in Domhnach Sechnaill <now Dunshaughlin in
Meath) by the St. Sechnall from whom that place
received its name. The occasion ol its composition was
the reconciliation ol the two saints alter their estrange-
ment owing to a depreciatory remark made by St. Sech-
nall about the teaching os St. Patrick. Sechnall was the
Irish and Secundinus the Roman name ol the author,
who was the son ol Restitutns ua Baird‚ a Lombard os
Leatha, and Darerca,a sister ol St. Patrick. These state-
ments involve ethnographical and geographical points
ol difficulty and obscurity, which are discussed at length

‚by Dr. Todd (Ibid. pp. 3 5-40) but into which we relrain

lrom entering here.
