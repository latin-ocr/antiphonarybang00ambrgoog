’ This may be accepted as a mark of the Gallican origin of a Collect, and as
a proof that it is, or at least was originally, addressed to Christ. lt is an
abbreviation of a termination which in one of its fullest forms stood thus:
‘Salvator mundi, qui cum Patre et Spiritu Sancto vivis, dominaris, et regnas,
Deus in saecula saeculorum'l Itis found in various abbreviated forms, and is
frequently indicated in Gallican MSS. by the single word ’811νε1101,’2 01 ον011
by its first syllable ‘Sal.’³ ln Celtic MSS. this termination is generally indicated
by the two words ‘Qui regnas’ ln the Book of Deer we find the following
Collect, evidently of Gallican origin, and in its full and original form: ‘Deus
tibi gratias agimus, per quem mysteria sancta celebravimus, et a te sanctitatis
dona deposcimus, miserere nobis, Domine, Salvator mundi, Qui regnas in saecula
saeculorum. amens* This Collect occurs again in the Book of Dimma,⁵ and
in the Stowe Missal,⁶ with the Gallican phrase ‘Salvator mundi’ left out. and its
address to Christ so far obscured. lt occurs again in the Book of Mulling⁷
in a yet more Petrine shape, with its original address to Christ forgotten, and the
‘Qui regnas,’ &c changed into ‘Per Dominum nostrum‚' 810. lt is remarkable
that it had already assumed its Petrine shape in the two places where it occurs
in' the Missale Golhz'cum,⁸ an Old-Gallican Missal where Roman influence has
made some strong marks

Other examples of Celtic Collects addressed to Christ, and ending with the formula ‘Qui
regnas,' 810, may be seen in the Stowe Missal.⁹

ξ 6. Commemoratzbnsof Martyrs. There are a considerable number of commemorations
of Martyrs in the Bangor Antiphonary, viz. in [11], [52], [55] [61] [67] [87] [97] [101]
[102] [103] [104] [124] There is no commemoration of any other class of Saints, such as
Confessors or Virgins. This conspicuous regard for martyrs in an early Irish liturgical
document is curiouS, because the lrish Church before 1111. 700 had escaped the persecutions of
heathendom, and had not produced martyrs. Martyrs, as such, are not invoked in the
Litany or Diptychs of the Stowe Missal. On the other hand, in the Hibernensis one whole
book (Liber xlix.) consisting of fifteen chapters, is entitled ‘De M artyribu5,’ and is exclusively
devoted to that subject, and in another Canon, attributed to St Patrick (Liber xxix. cap. 7) a
special penalty is attached to theft from a church where the remains of martyrs and saints
are sleeping. Mt. T. Olden has referred to such Canons to prove the non-Irish and
continental origin of much of the 111110111011513.10

But the frequent and pointed commemoration of martyrs in the Bangor MS. seems. like
so many other peculiar features of the ancient Irish Office‚ to have been derived from Gaul
