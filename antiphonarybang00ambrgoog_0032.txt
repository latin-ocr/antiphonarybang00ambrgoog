‘ INTRODUCTION.

One occurs in the Missale Mozarabicum. Col. 698.
Five occur „ Sacramentarium Gelasianum. Coll. 526 (bis), 702,

720, 748.
Two ,‚ „ „ Gallicanum, pp. 210, 358. ,

lt must be remembered that the Gelasian Sacramentary is a Gallican
’ recension of a Roman Sacramentary, and that it abounds in Gallicanisms.

With regard to Collects commencing with the word ‘Te' of twenty-two

collects known to us thus commencing, exclusive of those in the present volume,
(8001011011.) Α

Eleven occur in the Missale Mozarabicum, Coll. 114, 138, 179, 187, 194,
240 (frequently repeated) 467, 554, 624, 778 840.
Six „ ‚, Sacramentarium Gelasianum, Coll. 593, 631, 642,

744, 747, 749·
Three „ „ „ Gallicanum, pp. 288, 357, 361.

Two „ „ Missale Gallicanum, pp. 160, 168.

On the other hand there is not a single specimen to be found in the Leonian
or Gregorian Sacramentaries This fact may point with others to a Gallican
origin 01 the Hymn ‘Te Deum laudamus’

(i) There are traces of the HispanoGallican ‘Praefatio’ or ‘Bidding of the people’
in the shape assumed by some of the Collects eg. [70], [121]

(k) It will have been noticed that in the Bangor MS. the ablative case is sometimes
used instead os the accusative, as in the title 01 [2 3] ‘ad nocturno' &c

There is a note to the following effect by Dr. N eale quoted with apparent =

approval by Daniel:

‘Notandum hic et saepius in Officii Mozarabici Hymnis eam linguae
Latinae corruptelam inveniri, ex qua casus ablativus pro accusativo vel nominativo
paullatim in usum venit ; donec in hodierna Hispanorum et Lusitanorum lingua
fixum teneret locum, ut ‘calle’ ‘arvore' ‘commodo’ pro ‘callis’ ‘arbor’
‘commodus.'1

But this use of the ablative 0050 15 not¹ specially Spanish‚ and cannot be
quoted as a mark of Mozarabic influence. lt is found in the Utrecht Psalter (fs.
8612, 88r.), believed to have been written 10 the north os Gaul; in the Vatican
MS. 01 the Gelasian Sacramentary, likewise written 10 Gaul (MS. Reginae Suec.
316 cited as V, and edited by H. A. Wilson, Oxford‚ 1894, where see p.
xxxi.) ; in the Verona MS. 01 the Sacramentarium Leonianum, written in ltaly;
and it is probably a feature common to all European Latin MSS. of the
seventh century and onwards. How much earlier it began to make its
appearance this is not the place to enquire. There are no Western liturgical
MSS. written earlier than the seventh century.

(l) We would call attention to the formula ‘Qui regnas‚' which occurs so frequently
at the close of Collects in the Bangor Antiphonary, eg. in [17], [18]‚ &c
