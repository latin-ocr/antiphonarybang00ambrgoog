economy it varied with daylight. The mle of St Donatus (Cap. 76), almost verbally copying
on this point the Rule os St. Benedict (Cap. 41) ordered:

‘Ipsa autem vespera sic agatur, ut lumine lucernae non indigeant reficientes, sed luce
adhuc diei omnia consummentur.'¹

The number of N ight Hours has varied, but we have not sound anywhere a larger
number than three, unless it be in the practice of the ‘quidam Catholici' referred to in the
Rule ol St. Columbanus where four Night Hours seem to be spoken ol (p. xiii.) ln the
Apostolic Constitutions one Hour is specified between Vespers and Mattius, namely, (ΖοεΙωτονι.Β

ln the Benedictine Rule the hour ol rising for the ‘Officium Divinum Nocturnum,’ 01

· ‘Nocturna Laus,‘ or ‘Vigiliae Nocturnae' was the ‘octava hora noctis' ie 2 am, so as to

enable Mattius to be begun at daybreak.³

ln the Spanish Rule of St. Fructuosus, the monks are ordered to observe ‘Prima Tertia,
Sexta, Nona, Vespera, Media nox' and ‘Gallicinium’ and it is added ‘Has horas canonicas
ab Oriente usquein Occidentem, Catholica, id est, universalis indesinenter celebrat Ecclesia*

The arrangement of the N ight Hours which existed at Bangor seems to have included,
aster Vespers, three ServiceS, viz. 1. Ad Initium noctis; 2. Ad N octumum; 3. Ad Matutinam.

lt must have been a difficult arrangement to carry out under any circumstances and in
any place. ll practicable in the warm nights in Southern Gaul and Spain it must have been
intolerable in the chilly nights in lreland. Perhaps, however, it was modified in practice both
there and elsewhere.

lt will have been noticed that there is no mention in any Celtic Rule, nor in the Bangor
MS. os Compline. That Service had probably not yet been introduced into lreland, although
it had long previously obtained a recognised place in the Rule os St. Benedict.⁵

lt is only fair to add that Dom Suitbert Baeumer, whose recent death is a great loss to
Liturgiology, stoutly maintains that the service ‘ad initium noctis' was Compline. He even traces
the Confession os Compline in the Anthem ‘lhjuste egimus' by a flight os lancy in which few
will follow him.⁶ It seems to us a natural and almost a necessary inference srom the paragraph
in the Rule os St. Columbanus beginning ‘ad initium vero noctis' etc. (p. xiii.) that this service
was one of the ‘nocturnae vigiliae,' among which it is there plainly enumerated.

The whole scheme os the Celtic Divine Office is an illustration os the great variety
originally existing in the structure and arrangement of the Church’s services, os which Cassian
speaks at length, and deprecatingly, in the second chapter of the second book os his De
Coenobiorum lnstz'lutz's,⁷ and also os the extraordinary devotion, and capacity sor devotion in
the Irish nation, to which Walafrid Strabo thus bore evidence in the ninth century: “Quamvis
autem geniculationis morem tota servet ecclesia, tamen praecipue huic operi Scotorum insistit
