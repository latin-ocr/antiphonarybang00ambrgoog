aiunl os Ireland, which Appendix received the ap
proval of the General Synod in 1891.

It consists of eleven quatrains or stanzas of four liues
each. The lines are iambic penthemime, and trochaic
dimeter catalectic alternately. It has been fancifully
suggested that there are eleven stanzas in this Hymn
because there were eleven Apostles who were present at
the institution of the Eucharist aud received it worthily.

Stanaa. Line.

I r ‘Sancti’ Dr. Neale entirely omitted
this word in his translation beginning
‘Draw nigh and take the Body of the
Lord' (Hymns Ancr'ent and Modern,
No. 313) and Dr. Bickersteth mis
translated it in the following line,
‘Corne take by saith the Body of
your Lord’ (Hymnal Compam'on,
revised edition, London, 1880, No.
383.) The words ‘by faith 'repre-
sent and translate, not the ‘sancti' of
verse i. but the ‘creduli’ of verse
viii.

4 We have altered the last word ‘san-
guine' into ‘sanguinem' in accor-
dance with grammatical requirement.
Perhaps the horizontal line over its
last syllable has been accidentally
omitted. Perhaps it has been at·
tracted into the case of the preceding
‘quo' It is curious that in the
corresponding line in col. i. ‘san-
guinem’ has been written instead of
‘sanguine'

1-4 ‘Hoc sacramento ' &c Dr. Neale did not
translate this verse, misled, no doubt,
by Daniel, who accidentally omitted·
it in his first printing of the Hymn,
but who apologised for and explained
the omission afterwards. (Dan. Torn.
11. p. 109.)

Τ111 expression ‘ab inferni faucibus
may be illustrated by the expression
‘de suppliciis inferni ¹ in [77]

VIII 1 ‘Accedunt' MS. almost certainly a

clerical error for ‘accedant'

XI 1 ‘Alfa et ω’ MS. In the only early
extant Irish MS. of the Apocalypse
this title of our Lord is written as it
is here, the Alfa (for Alpha) in full,
and the Omega as the small Greek
letter (ω). So they are in the only
liturgical passage known to the editor

in which they occur, via, in a
Morarabic ‘Post Nomina' ‘In Do
minica ante Epiphaniam Domini!
(Book of Armagh, and P.L. Tom.
lxxxv. col. 225.)

It is very likely that these symbols were stamped
upon the Eucharistic waler bread. The following
canon was passed in a provincial synod held under John
Comyn, Archbishop of Dublin in 1186. ‚

‘4th. That the host, which represents the Lamb
without spot, the Alpha and Omega, be made so white
and pure. that the partakers thereos may thereby under·
stand the purifying and feeding of their souls rather than
their bodies! (Sir Jus. Ware's Works, Dublin, 1764,
voli. p. 316.)

The original Latin has perished, but it was in existence
in Sir James Wure’s time (1594-1666) in a very decayed
state among the Archives of Christ Church‚ Dublin.

Title. We have altered the MS. ‘coeria’into ‘cereus’
There seems to beno authority for such a form as
‘coeria’ or ‘cerea' The metre of the hymn is iambic
dimeter acatalectic.

This Hymn is not found elsewhere. Itis not certain
from its title, nor from its contents‚ whether it was
intended to be sung daily at the lighting of the lamps
at the ‘Hora Vespertina,’ or the ‘Lucemarium,' or
whether it is connected with the benediction and
lighting of the Paschal candle on Easter Even. A
similar doubt has existed with regard to Prudentius’
well-known Hymn ‘Inventor rutili &c' inscribed ‘ad
incensum lucernae! (Dan. Tom. i. p. 13²· Duoange
Glossarium sub. voc. Cereus.) In mediaeval office
books it is associated with the lighting of the Paschal
candle on Easter Even‚ but this may be the solitary
survival, in its most solemn form of a ceremonial used
if not daily, at least frequently, in connection with the
Lucernarium.

The following points seem to favour the connection
of this Hymn [9] with Easter Even.

(a) The reference to the escape from Egypt in
stanzas iii. and iv.

(b) The reference to the work of the bee in the
manufacture of wax and honey in stanzas vi. 111. 1111.
This subject is worked out at great length in the preface
for the ‘Benedictio Cerei in Sabbato Sancto’ in the
older Missals. (See leofric Missal, Oxfotd, 1883, p.
97. llfr'ssale Gallicanum, p. 185.)

(c) The possible reference to baptism in stanza vii.
but the reference here may be to the adoption of the
