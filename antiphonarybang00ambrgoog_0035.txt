St. Maximus of Turin says:

“ Martyr Latine testis dicitur, ac quotiescunque bonis actibus mandatum Christi facimus
toties Christo testimonium perhibemus. Unde et cmx Domini non illa tantum dicitur quae
passionis tempore ligni affixione construitur, sed et illa quae totius vitae curriculo cunctarum
disciplinarum virtutibus cooptatur.''l

This Gallican view ol what constitutes a martyr seems to have been reproduced in
lreland. St. Patrick is included among the martyrs in the Book of Obils of Christ Chuni,
Dublin,2 ‘unde etiam animo et summa intentione persecutiones sustinendo martyr effectus’
His claim to the title is thus explained and justified in the septima vita published by Colgan:
‘¹ N ec incongrue martyrem dixeris, qui crucem Christi in corde ac corpore continuo gestavit,
qui continuo cum Magis curn Regibus ac Principibus idolatris et cum daemonibus
conflictando corpus suum mille mortis generibus obiecit, acad ea subeunda cor semper habuit
paratum ; et sic viventem Domino semper se exhibuit hostiam.”³

We have felt it due to our readers to place this possstile interpretation of the term
‘martyr’ before them. N evertheless the language in which martyrs and martyrdom are
described in some ol the Bangor CollectS, eg. in [67]‚ [101], is too graphic and realistic to Ι
admit of this interpretation being accepted, in our opinion, as the true one.

§a Versian of Holy Scriptura employed. Scriptura] passages of varying length occur
chiefly in the form of Canticles or Anthems. They are taken from the following nine books
of Holy Scripture: Exodus Deuteronomy, Psalms, Daniel, St. Matthew, St. Luke, St. J0hn,
Acts Revelation. Two passages viz.,. the first anthem in [34], and the fifteenth anthem in
[99], also occur in the Book of Judith. But in Judith, as in the Bangor Antiphonary, they are
quotations from the Books ol Psalms and Exodus respectively. judith, therefore, is not
entitled to a place in the above list.

These scriptural extracts exhibit a mixed text, partly Vulgate, partly Old-Latin,¹ with the
intermixture of readings apparently not found elsewhere

The following tables will illustrate this statement

Exonus xv. 1⁶19 [5] fol. 7r. p. 8‘.

The variations of reading between B and V throughout this passage are so numerous that
the best way to exhibit thern will be by printing the two texts throughout in parallel columns
italicizing the variations in B. The third column contains authorities for the B text, and Old-
Latin variations therefrom, as given by P. Sabatier, Bibliarum Sacrorum Latinae Verszanes
Antiquae seu Vetus Italica, Parisiis, 1751. W here no variation of text is marked it may be
concluded that the text ol the Old-Latin authorities quoted agrees with B.

The following are the authorities made use ol by Sabatier in those portions of the Old
Testament text with which we have to deal. A meagre account of them is given in his
Praefati0, capp. lxxiv-lxxix. We refer to them by the aid of Arabic and Roman numerals.
