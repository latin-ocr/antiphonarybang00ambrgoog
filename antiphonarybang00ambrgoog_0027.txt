uvrnooucrrox. xxiii

(a) The repetition ol the relrain in ‘Benedicite omnia opera’ [6] alter each verse
in that canticle, ‘hymnum dicite, et superexaltate eum in saecula'

This arrangement is peculias to the Eastern Church, where, in the Greek
Office, the Song of the Three Children forms the eighth ol the nine Odes
appointed lor Mattins (Opdpoc), whereas in Western Breviaries, both secular
and monastic, the refrain is repeated only lour times.

(b) The assignment of Collects to the close ol each Canticle, and is we may inser
from the title to [64] to the close ol each Psalm, or set ol Psalms, is a primitive
Eastern feature, os which we find traces in the Peregrinatio Syloiae,1 the
writings os St. Basil,2 and the Institutes of Cassian‚³ and in some ol the Office
Books now in use in the Eastern Church, as eg. the Armenian.

(c) The presence in the Divine Office ol the ceremony of the kiss of peace See
note to [34]

(d) The use ol Psalm lxxxix. daily at Prime. See note to [98.]

(e) The long Collects provided lor use ‘post Cantica,' especially [91]-[94] are very
unlike Petrine Collects, which are usually short and terse They bear lar more
resemblance to some Oriental prayers.

(f) The lestal observance of Saturday as well as Sunday. On this point we must
go a little more into detail.

ln Eastern Christendom both the Saturday and the Sunday, both the Sabbath and the
Lord’s Day, were marked for festal observation.

ln the Apostolic Constitutions‚ Christians are exhorted to meet together in church daily
for worship, “ but especially upon the Sabbath Day and on the Lord’s Day, which is the Day
ol the Lord's resurrection, to praise God, Who made all things byJesus, and Who sent Him to
uS, and delivered Him to suffer, and raised Him from the dead ’' (ie.- on the first day ol the
weelc.)4

They are enjoined to:

‘⁴ Keep the Sabbath and the Lord's Day as feasts‚ because one is a memorial ol the
creation, and the other ol the resurrection.”⁵

lt is ordered:

‘⁴ Let servants work on five days, but let them rest on the Sabbath and on the Lord's
Day, in the Church, with a view to the teaching of piety.'’⁰

ln the Apostolic Canons it is laid down:

⁴* ll any cleric be found lasting on the Lord's Day, or on the Sabbath Day, except
on one Sabbath Day only, (ie. Easter Even) let him be deposed; il a laic, let
him be excommunicated.'’⁷
