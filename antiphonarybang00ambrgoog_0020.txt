Three Psalms are assigned to each of the Day Hours which are followed by a number ol
devotion5‚ or ‘Preces' in the lorm of Versicles introducing Collects (1) lor our sins; (2) lor
all Christian people; (3) sor priests, and for other persons consecrated to God in the various
grades of the ministry; (4) sor those who give alms; (5) for the peace os kings; (ό) for our
enemres

From the position ol these intercessione ··[4o}[56] in the Bangor Book, where they are
enlarged in number and slightly varied in the wording ol their titles, it would appear that they
were used at the end ol MattinS, but the wording os the Rule ol St. Columbanus, previously
quoted, implies their attachment to all the Day Honrs

lt may bea convenience to exhibit the arrangement ol the ‘Cursus Psalmorum' in the
Celtic Divine Office in a tabular form:

Name of Office. Hour. No. os Psalms.

1. Ad Secundam Brime .6 am. 3)
2. Ad Tertiam Terce 9a.m. 3
3. Ad Sextam ‘Sext ‘Noon 3 )

8. Ad Matutinam { Lauds or Mat} ¹3a.m.¹ {24-36Mondayt0Fr1day.
gns· 36-7 5 Saturday, Sunday.

The complicated mode oi varying the number ol Psalms ·‘Ad Matutinam’ has been
already described. We would only add that the obscure wording os the Rule may point to the
further lact that the four equal divisions ol the year were not exactly adhered to, so that the
rate os increase or decrease might have to be accelerated or retarded in the autumn
or spring. For example the decrease 'in the num'ber ol the ¹Psalms seems to have begun
after Midsummer Day and not on Aug. rst, and il so it would 'have to be spread over a
longer period of t‘ime t'han exactly t'hree months or thirteen weeks.

We now approach a question, notos much importance, 'but of some difficulty. Does the
service ‘Ad vespertinam’ belong to the series oi Day Hours or ol Night Hours? The
normal hour to which it was attached was, as 'its name ‘Duodecima’ indicates 6 pm. is
Prime said at 6 am. was the first os the ‘Day Hom, then, 'if we divide day and night equally,
Vespers said at 6 pm. ought to be regarded as the first of the Night Hours.³

somewhat similar arrangement sor the increase and decrease ol Psalms ‘ad matutinam ’ is laid down in canon 18 of
the second Council of Tours (no. 567). See J. Mabillon, De Cursu Gallicano, 55, n. 52· P. L. Tom. lxxii.col.405.·

¹ or ‘Ad Duodecimam ’ see-quotationin page-xiv. note 3. *fhis hour was also called ‘Lucernarium' ‘Eucharistia,'
‘Hora Incensi.’ (Mart. Tom. iv. p. 3²·) Lucernarium has a double meaning. It is sometimes used for Vespers,
sometimes lor the short service attending the lighting ol lamps, which took place immediately before Vespers. So in
the ‘Regula S. Aureliani' in the ‘ordo 'Psallendi' appended to the Canons'fflo'lst. Pt. ii. p. 67.)

² This column represents the normal hours, in theory. They musthavebeen sometimes departed from in practice.

⁸ Sed Prima sic debet dici, quomodo :Duodecimm quae dicitur Vespera.'’ (Regula Magistri, cap. xxxiv. Holst. Pt. ii.
p. 2 32.) Yet according to this same Gallican Rule, three Psalms were to be said at Prime (cap. xxxv.) but at Vespers
six in winter and five in summer. (cap. xxxvi.) Dr. Ο. Seebass includes Vespers among the five Day Hours at
Bangor. (Columba von luxeuils Klosterregel dre. Dresden, 1883, p. 24.)
