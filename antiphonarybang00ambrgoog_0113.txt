The cross prefixed upon the margin to this title
denotes the commencement of a fresh subject. Follow-
ing close upon the Eucharistic Anthems we should
perhaps have inferred that ‘Gloria in Excelsis ’ was here
intended for Eucharistic use, if by any mischance the
rubricator had omitted to insert the title which tells us
that it is lor Mattius and Vespers (morning and evening)
use. This or similar to this was its original position
and use in both Eastern and Westem Christendom.
'In PseudoAthanasius de Virgim‘tate‚ which may be
as old as the fourth century, it is'directed to be said
‘sub diluculum’ at daybreak. In the Codex Alexan-
drinus (fifth century) it is entitled ‘vaoe ἑωθινός) In
the Apostolic Constitutione the time and mode of its
use are not stated, but it is placed immediately before
another Canticle‚ which is always associated with
evensong, via: ‘Nunc Dimittis’ (Lib. vii. capp. 47, 48.)
We may. therefore, conclude that it was for use ‘ad
vespertinam? And now in this early Irish Service book
it is directed to be used in the Divine Office both ‘ad
vesperum et ad matutinam!

This corresponds to its position and use in the Divine
Office of the Greek Church at the present day.

There it is said daily after the three Psalms (148-150)
in the 'Opopog corresponding to Western Lauds, a longer

recitation of it (δοξολογία μεγαλὴ) being used on Feast·.

days, and a shorter one (δοξολογία μικρά) being used in
Lent and at other times of fasting. It is also sung daily
at Compline, in its shorter forms, both at the Ἀποδείπνον
μικρὸν, 3ηά at the Ἀποδείπνον μέγα. (Horologrbn, pp. 69,
71, ¹672178l

It is both curious and interesting to find that the Irish
use of the seventh century and the Greek use of the
present day are alike in directing that this Hymn shall
be recited in the morning and in the evening in the
Divine Office.

As to authorship the Bangor MS. is silent.

Line 9. ‘et omnes dicimus amen! This curious
addition to the text of this Hymn is also
found in three other early Irish versions
of it, viz. those in L.H. L.H.* and in
the StorueMissal (W. pp. 197, 227) It has
the appearance of a rubric gone astray,

but there is no proof that this is the true

origin of it.
The same words are also inserted in the

Armenian Office for Vespers, in the text
of the well known Eastem ‘tnakdymos
erixapwrrb’ commencing ‘Quor ἱλαρὸν ἁγίας
δόξηςδ Immediately after the words ‘ And
the Holy Spirit, God’ is added ‘jev
amenekeanassemk. amen' tle, ‘and we all
say, Amen! (samagarkloouun. Ed. Ha-
jast. Vienna, 1879, p. 235.)

The twelve anthems which are here appended to
‘Gloria in Excelsis' are in six cases taken from Holy
Scripture, 3ηά iu six cases from elsewhere
Anthem.

(1.) Ps. cxliv. 2.

(a.) A translation of the second anthem after this
Hymn in the Codex Alexandrinus, p. 590,
col. 1, No. 28.

(3.) Dan. iii. 26. ‘Amen'is omitted in L.H.* but
with this exception the readings in L.H. and
L.H.* are identical. The opening words of
this autheni have been detached in the MS.
and added to the preceding anthem to which
they do not belong.

(4.) Ps. cxxii. 3.

(s) Ps· v· 2, a·

(6.) Ps. v. 4.

(y.) Ps. lxxxvii. 4.

(8.) Not from Holy Scripture. It occurs in L.H.*

(9) dv·

(ro.) do.

(11.) da. ‘uniuersa'MS.

(12.) ‘Gloria et honor’ &c This is the Mozarabic
form of Gloria Patri. It may be seen on
almost any page of the Mozarabic Brenthry.
An early mention of it occurs in Canon 13 of
the fourth Council of Toledo (au. 633) which
combating the opinion of those who at that
time objected to the use of all Hymns of
human composition, rau thus: “ Respuant ergo
et illum hymnum ab hominibus compositum,
quem quotidie publico privatoque officio in fine
omnium Psalrnorum dicimus, ‘Gloria et honor
Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto, iu secula
seculorum. Amen.’'’ Canon 15 of the sanie
Council explains the origin and orders the use
of this Mozarabic formula instead of the form
‘Gloria Patri' dre, which some people were
seeking to introduce.

The exact words of the second part of the
‘Gloria' as found in the Bangor MS. omitting
‘sicut erat in principio' are given by Walafrid
Strabo as the Greek form (De Rebus Ecclesias-
tinl, cap. 2 5.)
