Stanza. Line.

XVIII 1-8 This stanza may preserve some personal
recollection of the habits or of the
deathbed of St. Comgall.

XIX 3 ‘Caram Deo’ see stanza w. line 6.

., 7 The metre requires two more syllables3

some such word as ‘pergens ’ has been
left out. We have not found any

authority for the MS. form ‘domuens’
Is itan amalgamation of ‘domans’
and ‘pergens'? Possibly we should
put the comma after ‘insaniam’ and
treat ‘domuens' as a corruption of
‘domurn habens!

XX 4 This line is the fourth line of the refrain
of this Hymn, as given in full after
the introductory verse.

XXI r The MS. form of Christus is retained as
essential to the alphabetical sequence
of the verses.

3 This is equivalent ιο styling St. Comgall
the Vice-gerent of Christ, in the same
way that St. Patrick was called the
Vicat of Christ See [1315ιιῐιῑει xxi.
line 2.

XXII 1,a ‘ymnum immolabat! Compare the
expressions ‘immolatione per psal·
terium ’ in [93] ‘psalterium immolate'
in [100]. There is Vulgate authority
for such a use of ‘immolare' in Ps.
xlix. 14. It belps to explain the term
‘ImmolatIo' which, as well as ‘Con-
testatio,' is frequently found as a title
instead of ‘Praefatio' in the Old·
Gallican Liturgy.

„ 3,4 ‘orans’ Compare the habit of contin·
uous prayer attributed to St. Patrick
in [¹3] stanza xxiii, See also [¹5]
lines 13, 14.

, 5 See note to refrain‚ line 2. Does ‘sub
numero' here mean ‘in rhythm'? or
is there a reference ιο the ‘numerus
signatorum' in Apoc. vii. 4?

Refrain. 4 Tbere is an ‘s’ on the margin, with a
markos abbreviation over it, after the
last line of the refrain, to which it is
difficult to assign any meaning.

The anthem or collect after the refrain may be intended

to be a rudely rhyming anthem, as in the case of the

anthems at the end of [ι 3.]

‘Hymnus Sancti Camelaci.' This is an alphabetical
Hymn of twenty-four lines, each line beginning witha
separate letter of the alphabet. The twenty-fourth lIne
is accounted for by the insertion of an extra line begin·
ning with ‘p,’ and not in regular alphabetical order, be-
tween the liue beginning with ‘x’ and the line beginning
with ‘y.’ The ‘z’of the last line is not at its commence-
ment but is buried in the word ‘elizaro’

There are eight or seven syllables in the lines, which
are trochaic dImeter acatalectic and trochaic dimeter
catalectic alternately.

Very little is known about the saint who Is com-
memorated in this Hymn. His name, Camulacus,
occurs in the list of Bishops ordained by St. Patrick in
Tirechan's Collections in the Book of Armagh (Fol. 9 b.
W.S. p. 304.) In the same document the following
incident is narrated in connection with him. It is said
of St Patrick: ‘Et uenit per flumen Ethne in duas
Tethbias et ordinauit Melum episcopum, et aecclessiam
Bili fundauit, et ordinauit Gosactum, filium Milcon Maccu
Booin‚ quem nutriuit in seruitute septem annorum, et
mittens Camulacum Commiensium in Campum Cuini, et
digito illi indIcauit locum de cacumine Graneret, id est,
aecclessiam Raithin’ (Book oJArmagh, Foll. 10 b, 11 a
W.S. pp. 310, 311.) For the identification of the per-
sons and places named in thIs passage except ‘Camu-
lacum Commiensium‚' see notes in the Analecta
Bollandrima, Tom. ii. p. 44 But no one has hitherto
offered any explanation of the epithet ‘Commiensium’
or ‘Cumiensis’ as the word stands in the Antiphonary
of Bangor. The nationality of Camulacus or Camelacus
is uncertain. This name ‘Caomlach' or ‘Caomhelach’
means ‘the gentle' or ‘ the kindly one,' and has an original
Irish ring about it, but then is it the Irish equivalent for
Camulacus, or is Camulacus, or Camelacus, the Latinized
form of Caomlach? St. Camelac is not commemorated
in the Martyrologr'cs os oengus, or Tallaglrt, or German,
but in the Martyrolagy of Denegal there is this entry.

Nov. 3, ‘Caomlach o' Raithin' [Caemhlach of
Raithin, now Rahen, in the baronyof Ballycowan, King's
county.]

If the word ‘Commiensium’ is formed from his Irish
tribe or native place, there is a place in the northern
part of co. Kilkenny, called ‘The Three Commons,'
which may have some connection with it. (Annals os
tlte Four Masters,n.1>. 870. and Edit. Dublin, 1856,

vol. i, p. 516, note l.)
lf St. Camelac was a foreigner who accompanied St.
Patrick into lteland‚ the Commienses might be the in-

habitants of some district in Gaul.
