12 1120 Liturgy' and after the ‘Officium ’ and before the
‘lectio prophetica’ on the Sunday of the Advent of
St John the Baptist, and, if Leslie’s conjecture is right,
on Easter Day (P.L. lxxxv. 478, 7 5¹)· As to the Old-
2 Gallican Church‚ information is wanting about the
structure of its Divine Office, but the ‘ Benedictus' was
used either at every Mass or at least on certain F estivals.
The Sacramentariicm Gallicanum has six ‘Collationes
post Prophetiam ’ (Benedictus) one for Advent, two for
St John the Baptist, and three for Sundays. Judging
from the general purport of the Bangor Antiphonary‚
we conclude that it is placed here for use at Saturday
and Sunday Mattius, and possibly, for daily use at the
same office.

Verse 70 ‘eo' MS. This is probablya clerical error

as a sort of anthem. It is separated from
the rest of the Canticle hyan undulatiug

from this fact that the addition isan Irish

We come now to three inserted leaves of the MS.
foll. 7, 8, 9, containing in their entirety two canticles, the
‘Canticum Moysi’ commencing ‘Cantemus Domino,’
820, and the ‘Benedictio trium puerorum’ commencing
‘Benedicite omnia opera' These leaves are of the
original skin, andare covered virh the original hand·

- writing, andare in every sense part of the original MS.

It is evident that placed as they are now, in the middle
01 another Canticle, they are not in their proper place,
but neither an examination of the make up of the MS.

Ι(Ρο 2. p. xviii.) nor the consideration of its contents

enables us to lix upon any position from which they
have been displaced, and to which they must certainly
have belonged. If ve were to place them anyvhere
later on in the MS, we would place them after fol. 27,
which contains on its recto the greater part of a collect
‘super cantemus,' and 02 its verso a collect ‘super
Benedicite! But we are driven to hold the theory that

they were originally intended to be loose, and to bc
shifted backwards or forwards to that part of the MS.
where the collect or anthem occurs which was to be used
in connection with them.

Collects and antherus for both canticles are scattered
up and down the MS. e.g. ‘Super Cantemus Domino'
on foll. aaa, 232, 242, 252, 252, adv, 282, 322, 322·
322 3 ‘Super Benedicite’on foll 232, 242, 242 252 2 52
aba, 272, 322, 322, 322.

11 the question arises, ‘Why are not the other four
Canticles treated in the same way ’? The answer is that
there are no collects or anthems scattered up and down
the pages 01 the MS. which belong to them. The
‘Canticum Moysi’ ‘Audite coeli quae loquor' has its
own single refrain repeated again and again. The
‘Benedictio (Canticum) Zachariae’ has a single verse,
appended anthem-wisc at its conclusion. ‘Te Deum
laudamus ’ has a single verse prefixed anthem-wisc at its
commencement. The three collecta on Tol 35 are an
afterthought ‘Gloria in Excelsis' has twelve anthems
written in close juxtaposition at its conclusion. None
of these four Canticles have therefore the same need of
being shifted which exists in the case of ‘Cantemus
Domino’ and ‘Benedicite omnia opera' Τ120 difficulty
in the way of accepting this theory is not an insuperable

one, viz. that no other instance of such an arrange·
ment is known to us.

This Canticle, ‘A Song of Mosesss is taken from Exod.
xv. 1-19. It is also contained in 12Η.1 p. 3²· The
text agrees mainly with the Old latin. See Introd. ἓ 7.
Itis written notin verses hut in paragraphs, the conclusion
of each paragraph being indicated by the use of a triple
(:· or. . ,) and in onecase of aquadruple stop (. . . ,)
but no part of the Canticle is indicated for use asa
refrain, to be repeated at the end of each paragraph,
as in the case of [2.] refrains being provided in [99}

Use. In the absence of direct information as to the
use of this Canticle we must be guided by analogy. It
is not a part of any known Liturgy, though portions of
it are used occasionally‚ asin the Tract after the fourth
