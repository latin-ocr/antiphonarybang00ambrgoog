Title. The title ‘Hymnus in die Dominica’ tells us
the day on which, but not the office at which, ‘Te
Deum laudamus’ was used at Bangor. It is silent as to
its authorship‚ which is too controverted a subject to
be discussed here, but for which the reader may be
referred to elaborate articles by our President, Dr. John
Wordsworth, Bishop of Salisbury (Julian’s Dt'ctthnary os
Hymnology, London, 1892, pp. 1122, 1547), and to a
still more recent and very remarkable article on the
same subject by Dom G. Morin (Reaue Benedictine,
Fevrier, 1894) in which the authorship is ascribed to
Nicetas, Bishop of Remesiana in Dacia, c. 392-414‚
Archbishop Ussher, describing an unidentified Psalter,
incidentally mentions that lrish tradition is in favour of
attributing the composition of this Hymn to ‘Nicetius’
“ln LatinoGallico quoque Psalterio circa tempora
chrici .i. exarato inscribitur iste Hymnus ‘sancti Niceti’
(Hibemicae nostrae traditioni satis consentanee). . .
Latino-Gallicum illud Psalterium in bibliotheca Cotton·
iana vidimus.” (erole lk'orks, Dublin, 1841-62101. vii.
r>- 300·)

This Hymn is also found in L.H. and ult* In
LH. it has the popular, but unhistorical mediaeval state·
ment as to its origin prefixed to it: “Haec est laus
sanctae Trinitatis quam Augustinus sanctus et Ambrosius
composuit '' (p. 196.)

There is no indication there of any day or season for
its use. The anthem ‘laudate pueri' dre. (Rs. cxii. ι.) is

there as here prefixed to the first verse.
Use. There is no known traco of the use of ‘Te

Deum laudamus’ in any Liturgy,Easte1n or Western,
nor is there any ground bere for connecting [7] with [8.]
It is likewise unknown in the Eastern Divine Office, but
in the Roman, Benedictine, and Ambrosian Breviaries it
is used on Sundays and Feasts of nine or twelve Lessons
in lieu of the Respond after the last Lesson in the

third Nocturn. In the Mozarabic Divine Office it is
used on Sundays and Festivals at·,Prime, where it is fol-
lowed by ‘Gloria in Excelsis’ and the Creed (Ru. Tom.
lxxxvi. col. 944.) Old-Gallican usage is unknown, save
through allusions in ancient Gallican monastic Rules‚ dre.
e.g. according to the Rule of St. Caesarius of Arles (c. au.
527) it was said near the end of Mattius on Sundays.
“Omni Dominica sex missas facite, prima missa semper

resurrectio legatur; dum resurrectio legitur nullus sedeat. Ι

Perfectis missis dicite Matutinas, directaneo ‘Exaltabo
te Deus meus et Rex meus' (Ps. cxliv.) Deinde
‘Confitemini’ (Ps. civ.) Inde ‘Cantemus Domino’
(Exod. xv. 1-19.) ‘Lauda anima mea Dominum’ (Ps.
cxlv.) Benedictionem ‘laudate Dominum de coelis'
(Pss. cxlviii—cl.) ‘'l'e Deum laudamus,' ‘Gloria in
Excelsis Deo,‘ ct Capitellum. Omni Dominica sic dica-
tur. (Can. xxi. Holst. Pt. ii. p. 56.) At 'l'oulon it was
in daily use. See note to verse 16.

In the little later Rrrle of St. Aurelian of Arles (oh.
555), among other variations at Mattins, ‘Magnificat’ is
substituted for ‘Te Deum laudamus! (Ibr'd. pho.)

We conjecture, therefore, thatin the Bangor Anti-
phonary it is intended for use on Sundays (and perhaps
also on Saturdays and Feasts of Martyrs) at Mattins.
But see note to verse 16- See also [123] [¹²5] and
[126]

For different texts of ‘Te Deum laudamus’ see the
Comparative Table in the Appendix. 'l'he textual varia-
tions of L.H.* are noticed below.

Verse 1 This anthem, taken from Ps. cxii. r, is found

prefixed to ‘Te Deum laudamus’ in l..H.
aad tat* It is also found prefixed to a
different Hymn of praise in the Apostolic
Constitutions. (Lib. vii. cap. 47.)

‚, 9 We have retained the MS. ‘laudet’ asa
possible· reading, but the present tenses
before andafter it make it almost certain
that it ts a clerical error for ‘laudat'

,‚ 11 After ‘maiestatis' 1..H.* adds ‘tuae’

‚, 16 This which is also the reading of Harl. MS.
7653, L.H. aad L.H.* was not the Gal-
lioan reading in the seventh century, as
appears by the following extract from a
letter written c. 524-33 by Bishop Cyprian
of Toulon to Bishop Maximus of Geneva:

Sed ia hymno, quem omnes ecclesia toto
orbe receptum canit, cottidie dicemus.
“Tri es rex gloriae christus; tu patri
sempiternus es lilius,'’ et consequenter
subiungit “Tu ad liberandum suscepturus
hominem non orruisti virginis uterum; te
