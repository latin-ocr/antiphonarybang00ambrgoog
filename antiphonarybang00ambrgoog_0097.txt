Aberdeen Breviary. (London, 1854. Pars hyemalis,
fol. lxxxi.)

Stanza Line.

Introducrorystanza. This stanaa seems
to have been composed for and pre-
fixed to the following Hymn in order
to attach that Hymn to St. Comgall.
The Hymn itself is general in its
'phraseology It contains no bio
graphical details about St. Comgall‚
and no such special description of
his character that it might not be
applied with equal propriety to al-
most any saint, unless stanza xviii is
an exception, qa).

Refrain a This verb, as similar verbs in stanza
xx. line a, dre, is in the past tense,
and there is no indication, as there

' was in the last stanza of ’[13] that
the Hymn was written in the life
time of the saint whom it commem-
orates.

I r For Hymns beginning with the word
‘Audite' see note to [13] stanza i.
line 1.

, „ ‘pantes ta erga! For a list of Greek

’ words introduced into the Latin text
of this Seryice-book see Part Ι.
Introd. p. xix §14 See also [ro]
note to stanza xiii. line 1.

‚, 3 The MS form ‘anthleta' is the usual
’ Irish form of athleta (see W. p. 260.
note boa.) ‘Anthletae'are invoked
in the Lorica of Gildas, line 22.
(Book of Nunnaminster, ed. by W. de
G. Birch‚ London, 1889. p. 91.)
The Greek form is ἀθλητὴς· (Ep.
S. Ignatii ad Polycarpum cap. ii) or
dohopo'pon, zie. as St. James (C. A.
Swainson, Greek Lr'turgr'es, London,
1884, pp· 234·5·)
IV 6 ‘Stefanus' (MS.) is presumably to be
taken as a proper name, ‘the holy
Stephen of God’
‚ ,‚ ‘agius’ See note to [10] stanza xiii.
line 1.

V 6 ‘Carus’ MS. but the sense evidently·
requires ‘carum' The scribe may

have been misled by the ‘pignus’
in line 7.

‘Carus’ is a specially Ephesiae epithet
and occurs frequently in the Old-
Gallican Liturgy. (W. p. 258n. 43.)
The ‘Deo cari’ are mentioned by
Tertullian (De Paenitentia cap. ix)
and by PseudoDionysius. (De
Caelesti Hierarchr'a cap. vii. ἕ 7.)
The word ‘carus' only occurs twice
in the Vulgate, via: in Thren. i. a;
a Maec. xiv. 24· It never occurs
in the Roman Breviary or Missal,
except where Thren. i. 2, is read
as in ‘Lect i. in Coena Domini!
lt occurs several times in the Bangor
Antiphonary. See Index. It is
interesting to find St. John the
DIvine entitled ‘Domini carus' in
a trope of Gallican origin in an
English Service Book. (W.T. p.
a)

IX 1-8 This description of St. Comgall as
learned in the Scriptures, and care

’ ful in the administration of the
Sacraments, recalls the similar de-
scription of St. Patrick in [¹3]
stanzas xvii, xviii, dre.
, 8 ‘carus’ See note to stanza v. line 6.

XII r ‘apprendit’ a shortened form of ‘ appre
hendit’ which would make the line
too long bya syllable.

‘bradium’ is probably a mistake for
‘brabium,’a late Latin form of the
Greek ‘ βραβέιον.’

XIII 1-4 Compare the enumeration of ‘ martyres,
confessores, virgines, anchoritae,
monachi, episcopi, abbates catholici'
in a Collect in the Stowe Mr'ssal (W.
1>- 244)

‚ 5 ‘synodum’gen plur.

XIV 1, 2 There seems to be a reference here to
St. Mart. xvi. 18.

XV 1-8 The reference throughout this verse is
to Jer. i. 10. This makes us con-
clude that ‘eremiae' in line 7 stands
for the name of the prophet, and not
for ‘eremitae'

XVII 5 This line occurs again in stanaa xix
line 4.

‚ 7 ‘gratiam' MS. to preserve the uniforrn
ending of the lines of this verse in
(m.)
