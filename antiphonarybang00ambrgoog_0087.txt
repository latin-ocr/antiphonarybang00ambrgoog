The custom of ligbting aspecial Paschal fite is of great
antiquity. There is reference to the custorn in Ireland
more than two centuries before the Bangor Antiphonary
was written. St. Patrick is described as fighting it in
deliance of the edict of the pagan king Laoghaire.

“Sanctus ergo Patricius, sanctum pasca celebrans,
incendit diuInum ignem, ualde lucidum et benedictum
qui in nocte reffulgens acunctis pene per planitiem
campi habitantibus missus est'' (Life of St. Patrick by
Muirchu Macen-Machtheni in Book os Armogh, Fol. 3.
b. 2, printed in W. S. p. 279.)

There is also areference to hallowed tire in the Book os
lisonore,a fifteenth century compilation from earlier Irish
MSS. (Whitley stokes, Lr'oes os Soints, from tlte Book
of Lt'smore. Oxford, 1890, p. 277.)

This Paschal custom, origInating in the Celtic Church,
rs believed to have spread thence to the AngloSaxon
thurch, and through the latter church to the continent
of Europe. (L. Duchesne‚ Orrgr'nes du Culte Chre'tien,
Paris, 1889, p. ²40·) But some form of Paschal
illumination was known in both Eastern and Westeru
Europe at a very early date. (Smitb and Cheetham,
Dr'ct. os Christ. Antiqq. vol. ii. p. 1564.)

VI A friend has supplied the following
translation or paraphrase of these
three difficult verses:

‘It is now tnne, while the dark bee-glue
is eaten away (by the flaure) that with
all its filth burnt away by the (flame-
like) warnrtb of the Holy Spirit‚ our
flesh shall shine like wax!

‘Now storing up in our hearts the
hidden breathings of the divine honey·
comb, cleansing the iumost cells of
the beart, thou hast filled thern with
the word'

‘As a swarm of new bees, leaving its
burdens behind, on careless wings
seeks with its face (ie. in direct
flight) the heaven which its (inner)
spirit has selected!

different hand from the rest of the

Title. ‘Hymnus mediae noctis! ‘Mediae noctis
tempus est,’ ke.

This is a well-known hymn. Itis sometimes printed
as part of a long hymn, of which it forms a portion,
commencing at the ninth verse. This long hymn is one
of the three hymns given for ‘medium noctis’ in the
Mozarabic Breviary. (P.1.T0m. lxxxvi. col. 931.) lt
consists of twenty-one stanzas, and begins thus :-

‘Ihesu, defensor omnium,
Protector et mirabilis!

It hasbeen printed by Dan. (Tom. i. p. 46 ; Tom. lv.
p. 26), to whose notes the reader is referred for informa·
tion about MS. versions and printed texts. Daniel ad·
duces proof from MS. authority as wellas from internal
evidence that the Hymns ‘lhesu defensor omnium ’ and
‘Mediae noctis tempus est ' are separate Hymns, which
were erroneously printed together as one Hymn by
Arevalus (in lorenzana’s reprint of Cardinal Ximenes'
Breorhrr'um Gothicum, Matrit 1775, p. cxviii) and have
therefore been frequently treated as one Hymn since his
time.

Autborship. The authorship of this Hymn is not
touched upon in the Bangor MS. Instead of discussing
the point fully, we will content ourselves here by saying,
that Daniel is inclined to accept its Ambrosiam author-
ship, not only on the external authority of the Codex
Rheooot'ensis (nlnth century) but also and still more on
account of the close resemblance both in thought and
diction running through the Hymn to the following
language used by St. Ambrose in his commentary on Ps.
118. “Docet te propheta quomodo teneas Dominum
Jesum. ‘Media nocte’ surgebam ad confitendum tihi
