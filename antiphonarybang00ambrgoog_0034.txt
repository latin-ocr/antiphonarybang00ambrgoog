XXX INTRODUCTION.

or from the East through Gaul, and to have been somewhat blindly adopted from a land of
martyrs into the services of a church where martyrdom was either unknown up to the time in
question, or of rare occurrence.

ln the Divine Office of the East Syrian Church there is a Martyrs’ Anthem in the daily
¹evening and morning services. This anthemis of great length, beauty, and variety. St.
George and St. Cyriacus with or without his mother julitta are among the saints most
frequently commemorated by name.l ln Armenia martyrs were specially commemorated on
Saturday: ‘Oportet vespere diei sabbati agere Martyrum officiumst

ln early Gallican and Spanish monastic Rules there were special directions for the Feasts
of Martyrs, eg. ‘In Martyrum Festivitatibus tres aut quatuor missae fiant. Primam missam
de Evangelio legite, reliquas de passionibus Martyrum.³ In Dominicis vero diebus vel
F estivitatibus Martyrum, solemnitatis causa, singulae superaddantur Missae.’⁴

The following Eastern Canon ’js of special interest, partly because it associates the
commemoration of martyrs with Saturdays and Sundays in Lent, partly because it is
incorporated in the following way in the lr'is‘h Collection of Canons known as the Hibernensz's.

‘Sinodus laudacens'is [dicit]: Non oportet ‘in Quadrages'ima natalitia Martyrum cele-
brari, sed eorum sancta commemoratio'in diebus Sabbatorum et Dominicomm convenit.’⁵

lt is, however, just possible that ‘ Martyr 'in the Bangor Book is equivalent t0 ‘Confessor’
There is early Gallican authority for applying the former title to the latter.

The epitaph on the tomb of St. Martin described that saint as:

“ Confessor meritis, martyr cruce, apostolus actu.’'⁶

ln the opening Prefatio of the ‘Missa S. Martini Episcopi’in the Sacramentam'um
Gallicanum it is said of that saint: “Hic vir, quem adnumerandum Apostolis, Martyribus
adgregandum proxima'ita in rem tempora protulerunt. Dubium enim non est ut sit martyr
'in caelo qui fuit Confessor'in saeculo; cum sciamus non Martinum martyrio, sed martyrium
defuisse Martinoi⁷

Sulpicius Severus, writing to the deacon Aurelius on the death of St. Martin said: “Nam
licet ei ratio temporis non potuerit praestare martyrium, gloria tamen Martyris non carebit,
quia voto atque virtute „et potuit esse martyr et voluit.”⁸

lhnd again:
‘Sed quamquam 'ista [ie. supplicia] non tulerit, implevit tamen etiam sine cruore
martyrium’l
