NOTES.

vident sepultum
cinerem (l. regem) curn curribus
demersum mbmm (l. rubri.)
maris in fluctibus.
(later'm'sclte Hymnen des Mr'ttelalters,
Freiburg, 1853, Tom. i. p. 218.)
Muratori read the word ‘cicni’ and
Daniel, printing after Muratori, offered
the explanation that Moses and
Miriam were called swans, because
they sang songs (Dan. Tom. iv. p. 34.)
In Harl. MS. 1023, fol. 63u. (a twelfth
century Irish Evangeliariunr) there isa
list of the Kings of Egypt inserted,
which begins thus: ‘Fato cineris rex
regnavit in aegipto, sub quo in aegipto
iu captivitate filii israel fuerunt; hic
item persequens filios israel in mari
rubro mersus est, et septem in aegipto
annis regnavit. Post cincrim farao
cerres† xii. annos regnavit, &c’

XV ι ‘loquatur' MS. but ‘qu’ is frequently
written for ‘c’ in Irish MSS. and
ur'ccuersd.

XVII 3 ‘hora’ MS. The grammar requiresa
plural noun.

XXIV 3 M. printed this line differently, dividing
it thus,-Fune retruso—Danietcopied
M. (Dan. Tom. iv. p. 32, bne 95.)
But there can be no doubt as to the
right dlvision of the words. The
reference to death (funus) is intelli-
gible3 the reference to a rope (funis)
is not so readily understood.

XXV 3 ‘saturaturis' MS.

XXVII 1-4 This mutilated stanza is not easy to
translate. We have altered ‘odire’
into ‘odere' (= oderunt) as ‘Invi-
dere’ seems to stand fur ‘ invidemnt.’
Daniel proposes to alter and complete
the verse thus:

‘Cui invidere

Et odemnt, animam
Pro inimicis ¹
Prorogans precatus est'
(Dan. Tom. iv. p. 34.)

XXVIII 4 See note to [89].

XXIX 4 Possihly for ‘tradituro,' we ought to
read ‘tradituri’

XXXI 4 ‘Obtondit' MS. ‘o’being perhaps suh
stituted for ‘e' in consequence of

Stanza. Line.
the next word begInning with ‘o.'
[oris MS]

XXXIII 2 For the MS. ‘annos’ we have substiss
tuted ‘annis' The other alternative
would be to alter ‘millibus' into
‘mille,’ but the line would then be
a syllable short

XXXIV r For ‘protoplastum' see note to Title.

2 ‘Soboli’ may be the ablative ‘with his
wicked progeny '3 ‘mali' must be the
genitIve after ‘ultrice'

XXXVIII 3,4 ‘Supernis’ ‘Humeris' lt would be
neater Latin if these two words were
to change place, but there is not
sufficient ground for disturbIng the
text.

XXXIX 3 The metre requires that ‘ cuique' should
be treated as a trisyllable.

XL 4 Either ‘possumus’ is bad latin for
‘possimus,’ or the question must be
treated as a direct one.

XLI 2 For ‘micrologi’ (‘migrologi’ MS.) see
note to Title.

XLII 4 The ‘alleluIa' placed after the first and
last verses of this hymn is suggestise
of Eastertide.

Title. If ‘b' has been rightly expanded into ‘Bene-
dicti0,' we have here a Title not known to exist else-
where for this Canticle. See Part 1. Fol. όν. note 1.
Muratori printed the title as ‘Canticum sancti Zachariae,’
but ‘b' cannot possibly be an abbreviation for ‘Canti-
cum.’

This Canticle occurs also in LH. (pp. 191-3), where
it is headed ‘Benedictus Dominus,' and also in 1..H.*
p. 33. The text in both is substantially identical with
the text in the Bangor Antiphonary, but omitting some
merely orthographical variations, the more important
various readIngs have been noted below.

For a comparison of the Bangor text with the Vul-
gate see Introd. ,ξ 7.

Use. We have no statement or indication here as
to the use or position of this Canticle. In the Greek,
Roman, (both secular and monastic,) and Ambrosian
Service books it isin daily use at &popae or hands, but
has no place in the Liturgy. ln Mozarabic Senice
books it is used occasionally both in the Dinne Office
and in the Liturgy; in the Divine Office on certain
Saints’ Days ‘In festis de uno justo' (Pr. lxxxvi. 870)
