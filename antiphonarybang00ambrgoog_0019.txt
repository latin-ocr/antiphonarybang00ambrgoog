INTRODUCTION. XV

Et sicut crescit, ita etiam decrescit quinque choris: quaein primo Sabbato quinque
chorae augendae sunt, ut sint viginti, per alium autem Sabbatum una chora augenda est usque
ad Kalendas Novembris usque totus cursus compleatur, id est, viginti quinque¹ chorae
psalmorum qui per tres menses hyemis numerus complendus est in duabus supradictis
noctibus et post hoc decrescit per Sabbatum.

Primo Sabbato quinque chorae, et singula per alterna Sabbata, quia longius spatium est
ad finem hyemis usque ad aequinoctium veris, in cursu decrescendo quam crescendo, ideo
per alterna Sabbata singulae decidant chorae usque octavo Kalendas Aprilis.

Duodecim namque chorae tempore aestatis in sanctarum noctium cursu, id est, Sabbati
et Dominicae, cantandae sunt

Octo vero [semper] reliquis noctibus de aequinoctio veris in aequinoctium cantandae sunt,
id est, per sex menses, De aequinoctio veris in aequinoctium autumni, viginti quatuor
psalmi canendi sunt''²

St. Donatus, lrom whose rule the above is an extract, was a monk under St. Columbanus
in the monastery of Luxeuil. ln 624 he was consecrated Bishop of Besancon. There he
founded the monastery ol St. Paul (Palatius) lor Canons Regular, and placed it under a mixed
Rule ol St. Columbanus and St. Benedict, and als0, through his mother flavia, a monastery for
women, called St. Joussan, which was said t0 be placed under the Rule of St. Caesarius os
Arles. lt is obvious that so lar as the recitation os the Psalter was concerned, the Rule os St.
Donatus was modelled upon the Columbanian type.

lt will be seen that the Celtic Rule draws a distinction between Saturday and Sunday
nights and the other five nights of the week. On each ol those two nights from Nov. 1 to
March 25, seventy-five Psalms are said, ‘ad matutinam’ under twenty-five Anthems, each
Anthem being said aft‘er three Psalms, so that the whole Psalter was recited every week during
those two nights. From the 2 5th os March to the 24th os june, the amount os Psalms is
diminished weekly by one Anthem and three Psalms, so that on Midsummer Day there remain
but twelve Anthems and thirty-six Psalms. Then, as the nights grow longer, every week
brings an additional Anthem, with three additional Psalms, so that by the lst of November the
total is reached again of twenty-five Anthems and seventy·five Psalms. This is the rule sor
Saturdays and Sundays. The rule lor the other five nights seems to be as follows. lt is laid
down that twenty-four or thirty-six Psalms are to be said ‘ad matutinam’ Thirty-six is the
lull number, but in the shorter summer nights only twenty-four Psalms are to be recited.
lt is possible that there was a gradual diminuendo and crescendo in their use corresponding
to the regulation os a similar kind in lorce for the Saturday and Sunday, but there is no order
expressed to that effect, and it is expressly ordered otherwise in the Rule ol St. Donatus (see
last sentence quoted above.)

This arrangement of the ‘Cursus Psalmorum' in the Celtic Church is unique and
interesting. The twelve Psalms ‘ad initium nocti5,’ and again ‘in nocturno’ together with the
prolonged office ‘in matutino' point to an Eastem origin, while the difference between the
long and short nights in summer and winter shows how such an office was adapted to the
altered conditions ol the extreme Western country in which it was drawn up sor ιιεε.3
