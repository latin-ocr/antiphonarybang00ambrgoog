This Collect,.probabl'y intended for use at' Mattius, i's
carelessly written, and casually placed here, with no
connexion with what precedes or follows it.

The cruss which we hare printed at the commence-

not been for the distinct statement ih this title that it
was used at Prime. In Western Breviaries, Roman,

30, and with the nattual phenomena
referred to in this anthem.
