noras. 37

In staura xxxii the hymn runs :
‘Ante lucem turba fratrum.
Concinemus gloriam!

Daniel thought that he detected here an illustration of
the words of Pliny: “quod Christiani essent soliti
stato die ante lucem convenire carmenque Christo quasi
Deo dicere.‘' (Dan. Tom. iv. p. 31.) And that the
above lines indicated a very primitive date for the com-
position of the Hymn, and that they even suggested
or corroborated the tradition of 1 very early connexion
between the churches of Asia Minor and Britain! But
the reference is evidently not to the nocturnal meetings
of the earliest Christians in times of heathen persecution,
but to the ‘nocturns’ or midnight and early morning
devotions of the monastic orders. The phrase ‘turba
fratrum' also occurs in staura i. and, though capable of
amore general interpretation, probably refers to the
crowd of monks in the monastery of Bangor or else·
where.

‘Gallicantus' in stanza xxxiv. may be aliturgical term.
The title or mbric to ‘Aeterne rerum conditor’ and to
this hymn ‘Hymnum dicat' is ‘Incipiunt Hymni noc·
turni post mediam noctem ad primum gallicantum' in the
Cod. MS. Vetustiss. Reg. Sueciae n. 12 nunc Alex. ΙΙ.
(Thomasius, Opp. amnia, Ed. Vezzosi, Romae 1747,
t. ii. p. 404.) The first mass for Christmas Day in the
Sarum Missal is entitled ‘Ad missam in Gallicantu.’
All these expressions may point to a date after the
establishment and organization of monasticism in li'est·
ern Christendom, that is to say, to a date not earlier
than the fifth, and possibly not earlier than the sixth‚
century. The ascription of this hymn, therefore, to
St. Hilary of Poictiers, seems to beat least a century
too early.

In stanaa x. there is an allusion to the miracles wrought
by our Saviour in His youth. This points to an ac·
quaintance with the apocryphal gospel of the Child-
hood, a Gnostic productiori of the second century
which became widely disseminated. A Latin translation

of it is known to exist in a fifth century palimpsest MS. ,

at Vienna. (Smith and Wace, Dict. os Christ. Br'og. vol.
ii. p. 704) ¹

Metre. Bede quotes this hymn in his work, De Arte
Matrica, as an example of ‘trochaic tetrameter metre.'
His words are these: “Metrum trochaicum tetrame-
trum, quod a poetis Graecis et Latinis frequentissime
ponitur, recipit locis omnibus trochaeum, spondeum
omnibus praeter tertium. Currit autem alternis versi-
culis ita ut prior habeat pedes quatuor, posterior pedes
tres et syllabam. Hujus exemplum est totus ille hymnus
pulcherrimus.

“‘Hymnum dicat turba fratrum, hymnum cantus

personet, Christo regi concinentes laudes demus
debitas!

⁴‘ In quo aliquando et tertio loco prioris versiculi spon-
daeum reperies, ut ‘Factor caeli, terrae factor,' ‘verbis
purgat leprae morbos.''' (Beda. De Arte Matrica,
4231110111. xc. col. 173.) The lines (versiculi)
are trochaic dimeter acatalectic, and trochaic dimeter
catalectic alternately.

But we do not propose to discuss at length here or
elsewhere the metre of this and other Hymns of the
early frish Church. Those who are interested in the
subject are referred to valuable disquisitions thereon by

Dr. J. H. Todd (L.H. pp. 47-9), and Zeuss (Gram-
matr'ca Celtica, Berlin, 1871, pp. 936-62.)

Use. There is no direction in the Bangor MS. as to
the place where, or the time when, this hymn was to be
used. The Rule of St. Ailbhe of Emly (ob. 542) ordered
that it should be sung when the bell was rung for the
CanonicalHours: ’ ¹ ’

“The Hymnum Dicat should be sung
“At striking the bell for Canonical hours,
“ All wash their hands carefully,
“The brethren assume their habit.”
(J. O’Laverty, Historiam Account aff tlte Dr'ocese of Dorou
and Cannar, Dubris, 1884, vol. ii. p. 116.)

The Irish Preface to this hymn in L.H. (pp. 151‚162)
states that it was composed by St. Hilary after dinner,
and suggests its post-prandial use.

There can be little doubt however that here it is
intended for use at Nocturns or Matins.

Stanza. Line.
Ι The missing words in this stanna and
elsewhere in this hymn are supplied
from L.H.

1 The mutilated fourth word in this line,
lengthened out into ‘fidelium ' by M.
is evidently ‘fratrum' The second

- letter ‘r' is quite legible in the MS.
and a dissyllabic word is required by
the metre.

3 The third word in this line must be
‘concinentes’ which is the reading of
L.H. M. reads ‘concinentur,’ which
is untranslatable.

‚ 4 ‘laudem ’-‘ debitam ' L.H.

111 3 Cassanders text agrees with the Bangor

MS. in reading ‘uel,’ but L.H. reads
‘el,' i.e. El, the Hebrew name for
God, as is there explained by the
accompanying gloss .i. Deus.

V 1 ‘et terrae'lffl.

VI 3 L.H. reads ‘albus‘ which is only
