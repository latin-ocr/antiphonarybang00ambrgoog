ln estimating the weight to he attached to the presence of Old-Latin readings as against
Vulgate readings in liturgical MSS. it should not be lorgotten that the Old-Latin has up to

the present day succeeded in partially retaining its position in the Missale and Breviarium
Romanum, and, mainly through them, in the Graduale and A nlz'plzonarium Romanum as well.
Old-Latin readings survive there in the Pater noster, Gloria in Excelsis and elsewhere.
The Psallerrum Romanum ol St. Jerome has been retained in ‘Venite exultemus Domino,'
and in general in the special Office Books oi the Vatican basilica, where the Clementine
recension ol the Vulgate text has never been introduced.
