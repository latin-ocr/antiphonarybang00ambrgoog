ergo, quaesumus, tuis famulis subveni, quos

Printed from a seventh century MS.
(Cod. 212) in the Cathedral Library at
Cologue by Dr. W. Gundlach in the Epis-
tolae Aevr' Merowr'ngr‘ci in the Monumenfa
Germaniae, Berlin, 1892,Tom. iii. pp.434-6.

The mention here of the daily recitation
of ‘Te Deum ’ at Toulon is in contrast to
its Sunday use at Bangor, and at Arles.
See note to Title.

l'erse 18 ‘sedens' may bea clerical error for ‘sedes'
which is the reading of LH.*, as well as
. of the other early lrish texts, the ‘sedis' in
Harl. MS. 7533 being only 3 cacography
for ‘sedes’

„ 20 The MS. ‘sanguinem’ is an impossible
reading. Itis no doubt a clerical error
for ‘sanguine' which is the reading in
L.H.* as well as of the other early lrish
versions.

,‚ 21 It is not easy to say what is the true reading
here. L.H.* adds ‘tuis' after ‘sanctis'
and reads ‘gloriam' for ‘gloriae'

„ 22 We have not discovered the meaning of the
two groups of three points which follow
‘domine’ above and below the line, nor
have we found any instance of similar
punctuation or decoration elsewhere. See
Part i. fol. roo. note 3.

„ 25 The insertion of' ‘Amen' at this point is
not found iu L.H.* or elsewhere, but is
peculssar to B. One suspects it of being a
thoughtless insertion by a scribe, at the
conclusion of words where an ‘Arnen’
might naturally be expected to occur, but
it may mark the actual termination at one
periodos the Hymn.

„ 26 After verse 26 in both L.H. and L.H.* there
follows the Collect ‘Te patrem adoramus
aeternum,' 8331133]

‘This Hymn is evidently from its title a ‘Com-
munio' or ‘ Antiphone ad accedentes’ to be used during
the Communion of the Priests, of whom there would be
many, headed by the Abbot himself, in such 3 monastery
as Bangor. It may be compared with the following
early Gallican Communion anthem preserved to us in
the writings of St. Gregory of Tours: “Venite populi

. ad sacrum et immortale praesidium et libamen agendum.

Cum timore et fide accedamus, manibus mundis

paenitentiae munus communicemus, quoniam propter
nos Agnus Dei Patri sacrificium propositum est. Ip
sum solum adoremus, ipsum glorificemus, curu angelis
clamantes, Alleluia. (De Mr'ras. S. Mart. ii. 13) as
quoted by Daniel (Tom. iv. p. 109) 3ηά by Margaret
Stokes (Six months r'n tlre Apennr'rres, London, 1892, p.
217.) Ι have beer. unable to verify the reference It
is interesting to find it still surviving in use in W.T. pp.
xxvi and 19.

The following is the legend of the circumstances
attending the original composition of this Hymn by
angels, on the occasion of a singular meeting between
St. Patrick and St. Sechnall. We quote the strange
story as it is told in the Preface to St Sechnall’s
(Secundinus) Hymn in the leber Brecc.

‘ ...... or this is the cause, namely, be·
cause of the provocation which Sechnall gave Patrick,
to wit, “ Patrick is a good man, were it not for one thing,
namely, that he preachethcharity so little.'’ So when
Patrick heard that, he vent to Sechnall in great wrath.
It was then that Sechnall had finished mass, except going
to Christ's Body, when he was told that Patrick had
come to the place in great wrath against Sechnall. Then
Sechnall left the oblation on the altar, and knelt unto
Patrick. So Patrick drove the chariot over him, 3ηά
God raised the ground arouod him, on this side and on
that, so that (Patrick) burt him not. “Why shouldst
thou be(so) to me ?'' saith Sechnall. “ What is that one
thing,'’ said Patrick, “thou snidst 1 did not fultil? For
if Ι fulfil not charity, Ι am guilty of breaking God’s conr-
mandment. My God of doom knoweth that it is for
sake of charity l preach not charity. For sons of life
will come after me into this island, 3ηά they will need
their service from meu.” “I did not know that,’'
saith Sechnall, “that it was not from sluggishness thou
didst so.’' Then the angel said to Patrick, “All that
shall be thine.'' So then they made peace, Patrick and

⁴ Sechnall, and while they were going round the cemetery

they heard a choir of angels chanting at the offering in
the church, and this is what they chanted, the hymn
whose beginning is “Sancti venite Christi corpus” et
reliqua. Wherefore from that time forward this hymn is
sung in Ireland when one goes to Christ's Body.’

The Hymn is familiar to most people in English dress,
as translated by Dr. J. M. Neale, and contained iu

inserted by Dr. E. H. Bickersteth‚ Bishop of Exeter,
in the Irynrnal Campanr'on. It has also been incor-
