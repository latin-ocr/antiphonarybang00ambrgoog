‘In nomine Dei summi! This short and pious
motto which is written on the upper margin of the
opening page of the Bangor Antiphonary seems to have
been especially, if not exclusively, used by Irish scribes.
It occurs at the commencement of the portion of an
Irish sermon inserted in the middle of Lib. xri. cap. 24.
of an eighth century copy of the Hibemensis at Cambray.
(H. Wasserschleben, Die Inscite Kanonensammlung,
Leipzig, 1885, p. 70.) The ‘Capitularis descriptio' at
the commencement of the Chartres MS. of the ‘Hiber-
nensis ’ opens with the same words. (H. Bradshaw, The
early collection (γ’ Canons known as the Hibemensis,
Cambridge, 1893, p. 50.) So does the Hibemensis
itself in the same MS. (Ibr'd. p. 58.) It is found asa
heading on Fol. 52. of the lrish libellus Precum, Harl.
MS. 7653 (see Appendix) also ou fol. 46r. of MS.
Reg.AA. xx. where it may be reckoned among the
signs of Irisb intluence on that Northern English MS.
Also at the head of one of the Charters in the Carru-
lary of the Celtic monastery of landevenec. (Ed.
A. dela Borderie, Rennes, 1888. p. 164.)

‘Canticum Moysi? This Song of Moses taken from
Deut xxxii. ¹·43 is part of daily &popae in the Greek
Divine office. It is used at Lauds on some Sundays 1n
the Mozarabic Brevia1y; at Lauds on Saturday in the
Roman, etc, and Monastic Breviaries. Irr the latter
a ‘ Divisio' is marked ar verse 22, ⁴ Ignis succensus est
in furore' ln the Ambrosian Breviary it is used at
Iauds instead of ‘Benedictus’ on Sundays in Advent,
on Christmas Day, the Feasts of the Circumcisiou and
of the Epiphany.

Analogy would therefore point to this Canticle being
used at Bangor at Mattius, and if our theory of the use
of this MS. is correct, at Mattins on Saturdays and
Sundays.

On the other hand, this is the only canticle throughout
the Antiphonary of Bangor which is provided witha
refrain. The repetition of the first word ‘Audite' as
a catcbword at frequent intervals shows that the first

verse, or part of it, was repeated in the course of its
recitation, as the Invitatorium ‘Adoremus Dominum,’
prefixed to ‘Venite exultemus,’ is repeated several times
in the course of that Canticle at the commencement of
Nocturns in the Roman Breviary, and as ‘Nunc dimittis’
is farced in the Roman Missal at the distribution of
candles on Candlemas Day by the repetition oi its last
verse after each verse of the Canticle including ‘Gloria
Patri.‘ These are the only survivals of farced Canticles
or Psalms in the Roman rite of the present day. This
fact suggests the inference that this ‘Canticum Moysi'
was part of Nocturns, as distinguished from Lauds, at
Bangor, aud that it occupied a position corresponding
to the position of ‘Venite exultemus! But no similar
useof this Canticle is known to exist or to have existed
anywhere. lt must also be noticed that there is no
refrain in S. where the Canticle is, as usual irr later
MSS. written in verses, and not, as here, in para-
graphs, often consisting ol more than one verse.

Indeed we do not think that the inference is a true
one. For although [r.] is the only Canticle in B in
which the opening word of the refrain is written down,
yet it will be noticed that every other Canticle, except
‘Benedicite omnia opera’ [ὁ] which has an original
refrain of its own, is written, not in verses, but irr para-
graphs of irregular length, like ‘Audite coeli,' and we
believe that they were all intended to be used, like
‘Audite coeli,' responsorially not antiphonally. A
cantor or cantors recited the Canticle, the body of
monks or the congregation present breaking in again
aud again with some appointed refrairr tt so, this must
be regarded as a mark of the great antiquity of the
Bangor Book ; the responsorial way of reciting Canticles
and Psalms having given way almost everywhere, at a
very early date, to the antiphonal, but being still retained
at Bangor in the seventb century.

For the history of the gradual supersession of the
responsorial mode of reciting or chaunting by the anti-
phonal see P. Batiffol (Histoire du Bre'm'at're Ronmr'n,
rans, 1893, r>- 42>
