There is a resemblance and correspondence here
which certainly support the theory that this Hymn is
the composition of St. Ambrose. It dces not appear
among the Hymns attributed to St. Ambrose by luigi
Birnghi (Iuni Sincerie Carmi di Sane Ambrogzb, Milone,
1862.) nor is it in the Ambrosian Breviary. Tbere is
nothing to suggest an lrish origin for the Hymn.

Use. This hymn was part of the ‘Vigiliae Noctumae.’
According to the heading in the Mozarabic Breviary as
well as in the Bangor Antiphonary it was for use at mid-
night ‘De medium noctis’ (P. L. Tom. lxxxvi. col. 9,
32.) ‘Mediae noctis’ (Fol. nv.) According to the Rule
of St Caesarius of Arles it was for use at the first nocturn
‘Ad primum noctumum.' (RegulaS. Caesarti' ad Virgines,
Bolland. Acta SS. ad diem xii. „ianuarii ξ xi. No. 69,
Tom. i. p. 7 36.) According to the Codex Rhenoviensis
(ninth century) it was for use at Nocturns on Sunday,
‘Dominicis diebus ad noctumum.’

Metre. The Hymn consists of fourteen stanzas of
four lines each. The metre is iambic dimeter acatalectic.

For ‘variae lectiones’ throughout this Hymn see
Daniel ut supra.

lv 2 The MS. reading ‘Et quos idem' has
not been retained. It seems to be
just translatable. “lihom too the
same angel then had not dared to
punish‚” but the reading given by
Thomasius ‘ex Cod. Reg. Suec. et
Cod. 03 “Quos ibidem ’' is to be
preferred. (opera Omma, ed. Vezzosi‚
Romae, 1747, Tom. ii. p. 404.) The
line might also be altered thus:
